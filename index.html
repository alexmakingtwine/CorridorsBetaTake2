As hard as West squinted through his glasses, he could not see the seam that almost magically appeared after Nellie practically fell out of the driver’s side window to type in the gate code. The illusion of seamlessness was slightly ruined when the gates sputtered to a halt halfway to opening, and Nellie was not sure if Devi coughed or laughed in the backseat as an unsettling smoky smell gently wafted through the window.

“Is the gate smoking?” asked West.

“Would you rather it was the gate or the car?” Nellie asked.

“I’d rather it was neither,” grumbled West.

“I think it’s wide enough for you to just drive in,” Devi interrupted. 

She was right, but Nellie was careful as she maneuvered through the gap that was just wide enough for the protesting Volvo. It didn&#39;t close as they passed through and Nellie hoped the owner wouldn&#39;t blame them for that if she stopped in to check on their progress.

“We’ve been to Victorian ruins less run-down than this,” West said as they parked in front of the Bennington Mansion. 

“It has retro charm,” Nellie countered.

She looked in the rearview mirror at Devi, who had somehow already opened her briefcase and was setting up the sound equipment, headphones secure over her curls and mind miles away. Nellie rolled her eyes at West as she accepted the mic pack, but he was still glaring dubiously at the mansion.

“I’m sure you’ll make it look much more impressive,” Nellie insisted, but West was less sure. His camera wasn’t magical. It could only film what Bradford Bennington wanted his guests to see – an enigma, unimpressive from the outside, full of secrets within. Looking at the front door, the crew could have been convinced that the house was quite small, just the rounded front they could see with windows like portholes evenly spaced high above their heads. But they had each glanced at the guidebook, a vintage item that neither West nor Devi would have guessed Nellie was clever enough to get into her clutches, and while it did not have a map, it was easy enough to follow. They knew the rooms spiralled inside, and the mansion was more like an enthusiastic question mark than a circle. The guidebook also warned that moving through the house could be a bit disorienting, especially for the customers following along without eyes on the instructions. West would probably have known more if he bothered to read it more closely, but after so many film shoots it was hard to stay enthusiastic. 

West slid out of the drivers&#39; seat, tossing the keys to Devi who fumbled to catch them before she put them safely in her briefcase. She wondered if Nellie noticed how clumsy she was around her, how her professional demeanor slipped under their star&#39;s attention. But Nellie&#39;s friendliness seemed doomed to be only that: friendly. 

“Okay,” said Nellie, popping out of the car, rubbing her arms for warmth in the chilly California desert air. “Who has the guidebook?”

[[Nellie]]

[[Devi]]

[[West]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Nellie" tags="" position="375,300" size="100,100">“The guidebook is sticking out of your back pocket, Nellie,” said West, rolling his eyes.

“Don’t give me that sass,” Nellie said, swatting playfully at West before bounding up to the front door.

“Shouldn’t you look at the map first?” West asked, but he still followed, hoisting his camera onto his shoulder.

“Pretty sure the entrance is the first step.”

“You’d be 100% sure if you opened the guidebook.”

“Can you all please annunciate, I’m having trouble picking you up,” Devi said as she followed them.

“Oops, sorry, Devi. I’m not even clipped in yet.”

Nellie didn’t notice that West held the door open for her as she stepped into the house, replacing the guidebook in her back pocket with the mic pack, securing the mic itself to her turtleneck. She was glad she dressed warm. If it was cold outside in the desert it was even colder in Bennington manor. She hefted her pack higher on her shoulder, slightly regretting the amount of snacks she had brought. But who knew how long they would be here? She wasn’t leaving until they got something good. Or, something she could edit later to make look compelling. 

But it shouldn’t be hard. Nellie craned her neck as she stared up at a ceiling of glass that curved upwards into a point, like the world’s most fragile circus tent. There was something strange about how the ceiling met the walls, neatly on the right but… shadowy on the left. It was asymmetrical, but it couldn’t have been, or it should have been slanted, right? Nellie could barely see the lights embedded in the frame that held the wide glass planes above them, but she counted the burnt-out bulbs and was surprised that there were more on the right than the left. Recounting them just made her dizzy. But it would make great B-roll, maybe for the intro - 

Nelli jumped when the door slammed shut behind them. Devi looked bored, already yawning even though it wasn’t even midnight yet, and she probably didn’t even notice Nellie’s reaction, but Nellie glared at West anyway.

“It’s a heavy door,” West shrugged.

“If the footage is wobbly, I swear I’ll-”

“Fix it in post?” West suggested.

“Guys. Be professional,” Devi said, one hand holding her headphones in place. “Okay, Nellie. What does the guidebook say?”

Nellie opened the guidebook.

“This is the entry room,” she said, careful to annunciate for Devi.

“Riveting stuff,” West mumbled.

“Okay then… This is the entry room of Bennington Mansion, constructed in 1975 by Bradford Bennington, oil tycoon, arms dealer, but more officially, movie producer. Wait, no, construction was completed in 1975, but started in 1969. It was beset by… wow, earthquakes, which made building hazardous. Ha. Understatement. Though he dreamed of making it a family home, but the time it was finished, his youngest was a teenager, and his oldest kids were enjoying the groovy times of disco. And hard drugs. But the mansion got a reputation for the dance parties, live music, and… oops, yeah, as a solid place to secure a mind-bending trip. Not the homely vibe he was going for but hey, he did manage to keep the family together. All of his children lived here until tragedy struck.”

Nellie waited for Devi’s thumbs up then massaged her cheeks from the smile she had plastered on.

“Until tragedy struck who?” West asked.

“All of them,” Nellie said, exasperated.

“An earthquake?” West asked.

“Not all at once,” Devi interrupted. “How do you not know the stories?”

“I never research a haunting before we film, it makes it more exciting.”

“I didn’t research either,” Devi admitted. “But I know the legends. Even in elementary school my teachers would talk about the Bennington Mansion as, like, a morality slasher tale. One man, three children by three women, all living under the same roof? It was doomed.”

&quot;But very 70s, free love and all that,&quot; West said. 

“You learned that in elementary school?” Nellie asked, impressed. “Your teachers were hardcore. But don’t worry, West, I’ve got the guide, I did the research, I am our fearless leader-”

“I forgot my phone in the car,” West said. “One sec.”

Nellie watched him struggle with the door for long enough that she considered opening one of the granola bars in her pack. 

“Please don’t break it, we barely got permission to be here,” Devi finally said.

“It’s like it’s locked,” West muttered, still fighting with the door.

“This is the kind of thing I need you filming, not fighting against,” Nellie laughed. “Get me in frame. Shh. Viewers, we have just entered, and already the ghosts seem intent on keeping us here. You know what they always said… once you enter Bennington house, you’ll never want to leave. They probably said it because Bradford had an infamously well-stocked wine cellar, but of course, we get the ghastly version.&quot;

West gave the door a strong kick while still filming and the door popped open.

&quot;Nevermind,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll just be a minute.&quot;

&quot;Nope,&quot; said Nellie, blocking his path, making sure to stay in the shot. &quot;You&#39;ve lost your phone privileges by ruining a haunted moment. Also, it might mess with Devi&#39;s equipment. Shut the door and let’s go people!”

West laughed and shut the door, lowering the camera. Devi gave her a thumbs up and after she turned away, Nellie’s wide smile dropped. She became a different person when she was “on.” There was always a bit of stress nagging at her when she saw the red recording light, but she liked that person who seemed so confident in the edits. Devi didn’t yawn when that Nellie was performing, and West didn’t talk back when she was in a monologue. That Nellie was powerful. The kind of Nellie that deserved nice things, like granola bars, and ten thousand subscribers. Maybe more. Chocolate cake and fifty thousand subscribers. 

“Where to, fearless leader?” West asked, and Nellie’s genuine smile didn’t hurt her cheeks nearly as much as her filmed version.

Nellie skimmed the guidebook.

&quot;Let&#39;s see where the good stuff&#39;s at,&quot; Nellie laughed.

&quot;Ha, she&#39;s probably going to start pocketing shit by the time we hit our first room,&quot; West grinned.

&quot;I am not!&quot; Nellie said, though she did enjoy keeping a thing or two from each shoot. &quot;I can wait until... the third room. Probably.&quot;

&quot;Guys,&quot; said Devi. &quot;Options. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

“Dining Room to the right, or we can see the Séance... um pit? And whatever else is down the hall to the left.”

[[Dining Room – Nellie’s Tour]]

[[Hallway 1 – Nellie’s Tour]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="West" tags="" position="850,300" size="100,100">West pulled the guidebook out of Nellie’s back pocket before she could claim her role as leader of the pack.

“I’ll be in charge,” West said.

He waited for Nellie and Devi to stop laughing.

“Oh, you’re serious?” Nellie asked.

“Yes,” West said. “Nellie, you need to focus on being the star, and Devi, you arranged this whole thing, you should get to take a break.”

Nellie shrugged, but Devi looked suspicious. She had a right to be. This was going to be West’s last tour with Spooktacular Investigations, and he intended for it to be a short one. He was tired of ghosts. 

Nellie insisted that her crew have experience with the supernatural. She claimed a haunted history because of her childhood trauma that, to West, sounded more like an imaginary friend situation or mental illness than an actual haunting. Devi had that weird encounter with a voodoo doll ceremony. And he told them he saw his grandmother’s ghost after she died when he was six. Which was true. He just didn’t mention that he hadn’t stopped seeing ghosts since. 

There were already three lurking in the entry hall, and not the harmless confused kind. These timeless hippies were glaring at him, like they wanted him to leave. Well, he would make sure they were out as soon as possible. He couldn’t even appreciate the curving glass ceiling above him when he was distracted by the ghostly overlay of mid-century modern elegance flickering over the dilapidated reality the mansion. In especially haunted locations, reality seemed more like an option than… well, a reality. 

“Can you read the entry for this room, then?” Devi asked, arching an eyebrow at him and he pulled his attention away from the ghosts and back to the guidebook.

“Why would I read the entries when we could just look at the pictures?” West asked, laughing, as he showed her the first page that featured a color-block illustration of three disco dancing faceless figures – a woman with a blond fringe, a girl in a frilly dress, and a man with a perfectly round afro. “Also, why would I read the entries now when you’ll just have Nellie record them later and add the voice over in post?”

“So we’re not confused while we explore?” Devi asked, exasperated.

“I know you did enough research beforehand to keep us on track,” Nellie said, surprising West by taking his side. “And if we know too much, we might try to see something that’s not actually there to match our expectations.”

“I didn’t do any research,” Devi protested, then sighed in defeat. “But I know the legends. Even in elementary school my teachers would talk about the Bennington Mansion as, like, a morality slasher tale. One man, three children by three women, all seven of them living under the same roof? No wonder they met tragic ends. It was doomed.”

&quot;But very 70s, free love and all that,&quot; West said. He went to check the time, already anxious from loitering in the entry room this long, and realized his phone wasn’t in his pocket. “I forgot my phone in the car. One sec.”

He went to open the door, and found that it wouldn’t budge. He gave the handle a few hard tugs. 

“Please don’t break it, we barely got permission to be here,” Devi sighed.

“It’s like it’s locked,” West muttered, still fighting with the door.

“This is the kind of thing you should be filming, not fighting against,” Nellie laughed, gesturing for West to shoot her, and he struggled to open the door and keep her in the shot. “Viewers, we have just entered, and already the ghosts seem intent on keeping us here. You know what they always said… once you enter Bennington Mansion, you’ll never want to leave. They probably said it because Bradford had an infamously well-stocked wine cellar, but of course, we get the ghastly version.&quot;

West gave the door a strong kick while still filming and the door popped open.

&quot;Nevermind,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll just be a minute.&quot;

&quot;Nope,&quot; said Nellie, blocking his path. &quot;You&#39;ve lost your phone privileges by ruining a haunted moment. Also, it might mess with Devi&#39;s equipment.”

West laughed and shut the door, lowering the camera, and Devi gave a thumbs up to reassure them that she captured the audio. 

“Where to, fearless leader?” Nellie asked, grinning at him but there was an edge to her smile. “Show us where the good stuff’s at.”

“Nellie, you are not taking any //souvenirs// from this mansion,” Devi warned her. 

Nellie shrugged at Devi and West flipped to the map at the front of the guidebook.

“Okay,” he said. “The Dining Room is to the right, or the hallway continues to the left starting with the door to the Séance Pit.”

[[Hallway 1 - West&#39;s Tour]]

[[Dining Room - West&#39;s Tour]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Devi" tags="" position="625,300" size="100,100">Nellie had shoved the guidebook in her back pocket, but enough of it was sticking out that Devi was able to pull it free easily.

“Hey!” Nellie protested. “I should be in charge. You’ll need to record me reading the entries anyway for the shoot.”

“We’ll get better sound if we do that in post in the studio,” Devi said, already flipping to the first page that featured a color-block illustration of three disco dancing faceless figures – a woman with a blond fringe, a girl in a frilly dress, and a man with a perfectly round afro. “Besides, we don’t want to waste your voice reading every entry. When we get home, we can figure out what information is relevant based on what contact we make.”

“Very logical,” Nellie agreed, but she sounded a little on edge.

“You seem pretty confident that we’re going to make contact,” West said, settling the weight of the camera on his shoulder.

“This is the Bennington Mansion, if we don’t get strange occult contact here then there is no strange occult stuff anywhere,” Devi said, letting West hold open the door to the Entry Room.

It was cold in the mansion, colder than the desert air Nellie was rushing inside to escape. Devi had told her she needed to dress warmly, and it looked like their star’s turtleneck was not enough to protect against the chill. Devi was glad she wore her hoodie. It was a few sizes too big, making her tiny stature look even tinier, but it was warm, like filming while wrapped up in a blanket. Devi took a brief moment to admire the ceiling of glass above them that curved upwards into a point, like Devi’s Nana’s crystal bowls that always seemed too fragile and sharp to use safely. The ceiling met the walls neatly on the right but disappeared into shadows on the left as it continued over a connecting room on the upper floor. Devi couldn’t remember which one it was, but she guessed they would find out as they explored. Staring up at the ceiling made her dizzy, so she turned her attention to the guidebook and read from the introductory page. 

“This is the entry room of Bennington Mansion, built and designed by Bradford Bennington, oil tycoon, arms dealer, and movie producer. Construction was completed in 1975, but started in 1969. Several earthquakes that occurred during the building process created hazardous conditions that slowed construction, but Bradford insisted that the mansion had to be built on this exact location to his exact specifications. Though Bennington dreamed of making it a family home, by the time it was finished, his youngest was a teenager with little interest in forming a close relationship with her much older siblings. His other children were distracted by thrills of disco and rock’n’roll, lured by the party scene of the time and indulging in recreational drug use. The mansion got a reputation for dance parties, live music, and famed séances performed by several members of the Bennington family (particularly Bradford’s three lovers) that made contact with spirits from other dimensions. All of his children lived here until tragedy struck.”

“Until tragedy struck who?” West asked.

“All of them,” Devi said, incredulous. “How do you not know the stories?”

“I never research a haunting before we film, it makes it more exciting.”

“I didn’t research either,” Devi admitted. “But I know the legends. Even in elementary school my teachers would talk about the Bennington Mansion as, like, a morality slasher tale. One man, three children by three women, all living under the same roof? It was doomed.”

&quot;But very 70s, free love and all that,&quot; West said. 

“You learned that in elementary school?” Nellie asked, impressed. “Your teachers were hardcore.”

Devi coughed, and hoped her crew members didn&#39;t guess she was hiding something. Her mother&#39;s history with the Bennington mansion, her secrets from the past, were not Devi&#39;s to tell. 

“You should film Nellie admiring the glass or something,” Devi said. “And I can see if we pick anything up in the audio.”

“I forgot my phone in the car,” West said. “One sec.”

Devi read ahead a few pages, not realizing that West was struggling with the door until she heard Nellie snort a laugh. 

“Please don’t break it, we barely got permission to be here,” Devi sighed.

“It’s like it’s locked,” West muttered, still fighting with the door.

“This is the kind of thing you should be filming, not fighting against,” Nellie laughed, gesturing for Devi to record, as if Devi wasn’t recording everything all the time. “Get me in frame. Shh. Viewers, we have just entered, and already the ghosts seem intent on keeping us here. You know what they always said… once you enter Bennington Mansion, you’ll never want to leave. They probably said it because Bradford had an infamously well-stocked wine cellar, but of course, we get the ghastly version.&quot;

West gave the door a strong kick while still filming and the door popped open.

&quot;Nevermind,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll just be a minute.&quot;

&quot;Nope,&quot; said Nellie, blocking his path, making sure to stay in the shot. &quot;You&#39;ve lost your phone privileges by ruining a haunted moment. Also, it might mess with Devi&#39;s equipment.”

West laughed and shut the door, lowering the camera, and Devi gave a thumbs up to reassure Nellie that she captured the audio. She could listen back later to see if there were any extra voices, whispers, knocks, all that necessary tedious work. In many ways, the exploration was the easiest part of her job. At least for this one, she had managed to steal the role of reading guidebook entries. It would keep her from nodding off in one of the rooms. West would have used her napping as proof that she didn’t actually think they would make contact, but the truth was she just wasn’t worried about the ghosts. She was sure they had made a few connections in the past with the spirit world, but none of those had come close to being frightening. The most frightening thing she had come into contact with so far on this job was the owner, a severe woman with Botox-tight skin who grilled Devi like she expected they were only getting permission to film there in order to rob the place. 

“Where to, fearless leader?” West asked, and Devi couldn’t tell if he was mocking her.

“Let’s see where the good stuff’s at,” Nellie laughed.

“Ha, she&#39;s probably going to start pocketing shit by the time we hit our first room,&quot; West grinned.

“Not with me in charge she’s not,” Devi said, and West and Nellie both nodded sheepishly under her glare like mischievous children. Devi glanced at the guidebook. “Okay. The Dining Room is to the right, or the hallway continues to the left starting with the door to the Séance Pit.”

“Flawless logic,” West laughed, but Nellie was pleased that he followed her all the same.
“Hold on guys,” said Devi.

Nellie stumbled in her skip and made a conscious effort not to resent Devi for breaking her stride.

“Is that…”

Devi was staring intently at a photo on the wall. Nellie thought the woman looked vaguely familiar, probably one of the Bennington family members. She knew she should have flipped through the guidebook to find out which one, but the way that Devi was staring so intently unsteadied her. That, or the way the woman looked directly at the frame, like she was looking at them, looking at Nellie. Like she wanted to be seen behind that fluffy blond fringe, like should couldn’t help but always be “on” for her camera. She smiled like she was happy. Her fringe drooped like she was exhausted.

“Is that David Bowie?” Devi finally asked.

“Oh shit, it is!” West said, and Nellie realized she was right.  The man who had casually tossed his arm over the woman’s shoulder was definitely David Bowie. “Holy shit, Mick Jagger is in this pic!”

Nellie vaguely noticed West pan down the pictures clustered in this part of the hall, but she could not tear her attention away from the woman, her smiling mouth, her sad eyes, how her hand gripped Bowie’s like the contact was the only thing keeping her here. Like she couldn’t bear being alone in the frame.

Devi’s touch on Nellie’s shoulder was gentle. West didn’t seem to notice that anything was wrong, he was so completely enthralled with the celebrities partying in a distant past with the doomed Benningtons. 

“Looks like we have options,” Devi said. “Where to next?”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Groove Room – Nellie’s Tour" tags="" position="375,550" size="100,100">Nellie looked around the room in wonder. It was large, built large but the wide steps that led to an indented space in the center that must have been a dance floor made it look even larger. A disco ball still hung above it, ready to shimmer, if only there was light. Nellie thought there might have been at least an nearly full moon out, but the small porthole windows did not let in enough light to allow the lazily turning disco ball to do its magic. Nellie did not know where the breeze came from. She didn’t feel one. It could have been a breeze from the memory of people dancing, living, in this room covered floor to wall in a green shaggy carpet material. She rested her hand on the wall closest to the door, surprised as how dry it was, how soft it still felt under her hand. She knew there were plumbing issues in the building and expected dampness and immediately, grimy regret. West and Devi passed by her, West filming the disco ball, then closing in on the carpeted green stairs that led to some unknown location, while Devi listened intently to her headphones.

“This place is…” West began.

“I know,” said Nellie, her voice full of awe.

She knew that the room had seen better days, but god, she loved that joy of the 70s, the disco vibes that brought people together more than the drinks or drugs ever could. 

Devi was saying something, concerned once again about the sound, and Nellie could hear West placating her, but she didn’t care. She could imagine the music that was swallowed by this soft green room, by the smooth bodies that writhed together. Her arms caught a beat that only she could hear, her hips swaying to a base riff from her imagination.

“Doing okay, Nellie?” West asked with a chuckle.

She looked up just in time to see that he was filming and gave a few extra turns just for the camera.

“Anything ghostly going on?” she asked them when the rhythm faded from her body.

“Devi thought she heard a song,” West said.

“A disco song?” Nellie asked, her heart skipping a beat, but West shook his head.

“It was quiet,” said Devi. “Hard to make out. I’ll play it back when we get home.”

“I bet it was contact,” Nellie grinned and Devi did something between a headshake and a shrug, indecipherable to Nellie but that was fine. Devi would tease out the sound, and even if it was nothing, she could make it something with the right gothic soundtrack behind it. 

“Anything we should know about this room?” West asked.

“They called it the Groove Room,” Nellie said and shook her head at West and Devi’s disbelief. “It was a very 70s thing, to have a space specifically for grooving. Those rock stars in the hall definitely came in here to groove.”

“What a decade,” West said, and Nellie grinned in agreement. “Unfortunately, without anyone to groove in here, this room is… um… dead, even for a haunted house. There are some groovy stairs we can check out, or back to the hallway.”

Like looking at pictures of her swollen throat at the doctor’s office after the bad bulimia episode. An inside view that should never be outside.

“Looks like a bathroom,” said West, nodding officially to himself.

Nellie opened the guidebook, if anything for an excuse to look away from the pink.

“Says here that it’s specifically the Girls’ Bathroom,” she said.

“Like, a gendered bathroom for parties?” West asked. “Is there a boys’ bathroom somewhere?”

“No, one sec,” said Nellie, skimming the chunk of text. “It was used for the public who came for parties or Bradford’s more intimate get-togethers, but privately, it was for the girls to use. The daughters and the wives.”

“Wives, multiple?” West asked.

“Yeah, I guess, there’s not anymore info on that on this page, but I did know he was a misogynistic creep,” Nellie said, flipping through the book before settling back on her page. “Okay, so the five girls, um, women I mean, Bradford&#39;s three lovers and two daughters would use this bathroom and it led to a lot of drama, blah, blah, blah-”

“Fascinating stuff, Nellie,” said West. 

“In conclusion, it’s a bathroom, and it was themed for the girls,” Nellie said, snapping the book shut.

“There’s no boy-themed bathroom, if you’re wondering,” Devi quietly added, making both Nellie and West jump from her sudden presence behind them. “Bradford and his son had private bathrooms connected to their bedrooms. But there was an issue with the plumbing about ten years ago and they got wrecked. The owner sealed them shut. So if you want bathroom footage, now’s the time.”

“Please, both of you,” Desi pleaded, standing by herself at the top of the stairs. “Stay a little further away from the giant hole in the floor leading down to…”

“The Pit,” Nellie grinned. 

God, it looked terrifying. It was perfect. Even if they didn’t get any ghostly encounters, this was just so haunted. No matter how hard she looked, Nellie only saw darkness. Who knew how deep it went? Who knew how long she would fall if she just tipped over the edge? Nellie didn’t want to tip over the edge, but what a way to go, right? Falling into some Amityville-style Hell portal. They would get so many views.  

“How about less leaning over the death hole and more reading from the guidebook?” Devi suggested.

Nellie pulled out the book, distracted by the darkness in front of her.

“Okay, so, while Bradford might have preferred to keep the séance room secure in the case terrible dark forces got out, his kids used this room for more… private party activities.”

“You are not suggesting that this hole is the result of violent 1970s sex, are you?” West laughed.

“No, apparently the damage originated on the ground floor, in the main séance room,” Nellie said, frowning as she read. “That doesn’t quite make sense. The giant hole is up here.”

“An earthquake at the time caused structural damage to a lot of the mansion, and is said to have upset some poorly made support beams that collapsed, making the center of the floor collapse,” Devi said. “But some people think there was an explosion of dark energy after a séance went wrong, and the explosion caused the hole. It was in the papers. And my mom remembered it.”

“Doesn’t look burnt…” Nellie murmured as she touched the edge of the green carpet, torn and drooping towards the darkness below.

“Maybe dark energy doesn’t burn,” West said. “Most of the dark energy we’ve faced has been cold.”

“I don’t trust you two to keep your balance,” Devi said, cutting off their speculation. “Come on. We’ve leaving.”

“Okay miss I’ve-got-the-guidebook,” Devi said, teasing but not mean. “The ground floor of the Séance Room is now the Séance Room Pit.”

“Damn, Nellie,” West said. “You were going to lead us into the pit.”

Nellie hoped the shadows hid her blush from West’s camera. She shouldn’t make these kinds of mistakes. This was her show. She was the face of the show. She was the fearless leader. She had the guidebook. 

“Well if they were so worried about the danger, they would have reinforced the door,” Nellie huffed. She tested her weight against the groaning hinges and Devi winced. “I could push this open if I had to. Hell, Devi could do it if she had to.”

“I could do it without trying,” West offered. 

“Yeah, West, I know, I was making a point… Forget it,” said Nellie. “Let’s keep going.”

“Damn, Nellie,” West said. “You were going to lead us into the Pit.”

Nellie hoped the shadows hid her blush from West’s camera. She shouldn’t make these kinds of mistakes. This was her show. She was the face of the show. She was the fearless leader. She had the guidebook. 

“Well if they were so worried about the danger, they would have reinforced the door,” Nellie huffed. She tested her weight against the groaning hinges and Devi winced. “I could push this open if I had to. Hell, Devi could do it if she had to.”

“I could do it without trying,” West offered. 

“Yeah, West, I know, I was making a point… Forget it,” said Nellie. “Let’s keep going.”

“You alright, Nel?” asked Devi. “Getting some static on the mic.”

“Sorry.”

“Did anyone else feel it get colder?” asked West.

Nellie shook her head. She didn’t feel it get colder. That wasn’t why she shivered. As they rounded the curve, it was like… well, not like she could feel someone’s eyes on the back of her head. More like, she couldn’t feel someone’s eyes on the back of her head anymore. She had been observed, but not anymore. It was always a terrible feeling for Nellie. That feeling of the camera being shut off, of going home, pulling the covers over your head and waiting to work, to get it done, to post it, to see the likes come in, to be seen. 

“I wasn’t paying attention,” said Devi, frowning at her briefcase like it held all of her problems, and if it was a sound problem then it probably did. “But I believe you.”

“Maybe I should have worn a jacket,” West shrugged. “You guys came prepared.”
Nellie rested her hand on the wall. It was colder in here. 

“West. Film,” she demanded, before turning to the red light and smirking. “I think we have company, viewers. Does anyone want to make contact? It’s safe here. We’re listening.”

Despite the silliness of its name, Spooktacular Investigations didn’t use EVP, radio channels, any of the tricks popular on other streaming shows because as far as Nellie was concerned, they were just tricks. All you need to communicate was an open mind. An entire team of open minds. All three of them had a history of paranormal connection. All of them had proved to the other side that they were willing to lend an ear. 

Nellie counted thirty seconds of silence before she shrugged at the camera.

“Guess they’re shy. We’ve got some chilly, shy ghosts or demons in the mansion.”

“Maybe I should play ‘Running With the Devil,’” Devi suggested. 

“Only if we’re desperate for contact,” Nellie said.

She pulled out the guidebook, allowing its weight and vintage cartoons of stars (or pentagrams?) to pull her back to the mundane of reality. Nothing really “haunted” had happened yet. Devi might have heard something in the groove room, but Nellie wouldn’t be satisfied unless she heard it herself. Half the time Devi thought she could some otherworldly voice it was the sound of the mic picking up the friction from Nellie’s turtleneck. Maybe she should stop wearing turtlenecks.

“It smells a little… funky,” West said, wrinkling his nose. 

“The 70s were a funky time,” Devi grinned.

“These three rooms belonged to Bradford’s children,” Nellie said. “Again, they lived here as adults, except the youngest. And they should be… ah!”

Nellie pointed at the molding mantels above each door, where pieces of metal twisted into the shape of a letter were still securely nailed: M, T, D.

“What’s the plan, Nel?” asked West. “We probably have time to explore two of the rooms.”

It smelled almost like… chicken soup? She had to assume that the smell was coming from the brown goop congealed around the tub’s plug.

“Are you going to touch it?” asked West.

“Don’t touch it,” said Devi.

“I’m not going to touch it!” Nellie snapped.

She kind of wanted to, though. It was like the smell. It attracted and repulsed her. A bad memory of childhood sickness that you could never forget.

“Don’t think we have time for that, Nel,” West mumbled.

“What the Hell, West?” Nellie snapped at him, but if West’s continued mumbles were an apology, she did not care.

“And you two were doing so well at getting along,” Devi sighed.

“Did you hear… Whatever,” Nellie said, deflating a little though she knew she was as pink as the room. “Screw you, West.&quot;

“Devi!” Nellie gasped and West chuckled with her.

“I just mean… this place has a reputation and that’s a medicine cabinet.”

“And when a place has a reputation like this one does, you’re not going to find any remnants of a fun time fifty years after the party ended,” Nellie joked. “Actually, you probably wouldn’t find anything halfway through the party. The Benningtons went hard. But…”

Nellie pulled a white ribbon out of the cabinet. It was carefully wound, but Nellie did not think twice before unwinding it to its full length.

“Thrilling,” West said dryly.

“Ribbons were big in the 70s,” Devi said, a faint smile on her lips. “Like The Cars’ song. &#39;Perfume... ribbons.. etc...’”

Nellie hummed the tune to the song, rocking a bit to an imaginary beat.

“Did you get that?” she asked and West gave a thumbs up.

As her crew left the bathroom, Nellie tucked the ribbon into her pocket.

It was large, built large but the wide steps that led to an indented space in the center that must have been a dance floor made it look even larger. A disco ball still hung above it, ready to shimmer, if only there was light. Nellie thought there might have been at least an nearly full moon out, but the small porthole windows did not let in enough light to allow the lazily turning disco ball to do its magic. Nellie did not know where the breeze came from. She didn’t feel one. It could have been a breeze from the memory of people dancing, living, in this room covered floor to wall in a green shaggy carpet material. She rested her hand on the wall closest to the door, surprised as how dry it was, how soft it still felt under her hand. She knew there were plumbing issues in the building and expected dampness and immediately, grimy regret. West and Devi passed by her, West filming the disco ball, then closing in on the carpeted green stairs that led to some unknown location, while Devi listened intently to her headphones.

“This place is…” West began.

“I know,” said Nellie, her voice full of awe.

She knew that the room had seen better days, but god, she loved that joy of the 70s, the disco vibes that brought people together more than the drinks or drugs ever could. 

Devi was saying something, concerned once again about the sound, and Nellie could hear West placating her, but she didn’t care. She could imagine the music that was swallowed by this soft green room, by the smooth bodies that writhed together. Her arms caught a beat that only she could hear, her hips swaying to a base riff from her imagination.

“Doing okay, Nellie?” West asked with a chuckle.

She looked up just in time to see that he was filming and gave a few extra turns just for the camera.

“Anything ghostly going on?” she asked them when the rhythm faded from her body.

“Devi thought she heard a song,” West said.

“A disco song?” Nellie asked, her heart skipping a beat, but West shook his head.

“It was quiet,” said Devi. “Hard to make out. I’ll play it back when we get home.”

“I bet it was contact,” Nellie grinned and Devi did something between a headshake and a shrug, indecipherable to Nellie but that was fine. Devi would tease out the sound, and even if it was nothing, she could make it something with the right gothic soundtrack behind it. 

“Anything we should know about this room?” West asked.

“They called it the Groove Room,” Nellie said and shook her head at West and Devi’s disbelief. “It was a very 70s thing, to have a space specifically for grooving. Those rock stars in the hall definitely came in here to groove.”

“What a decade,” West said, and Nellie grinned in agreement. “Unfortunately, without anyone to groove in here, this room is… um… dead, even for a haunted house. There are some groovy stairs we can check out, or back to the hallway.”

“Please, both of you,” Desi pleaded, standing by herself at the top of the stairs. “Stay a little further away from the giant hole in the floor leading down to…”

“The Pit,” Nellie grinned. 

God, it looked terrifying. It was perfect. Even if they didn’t get any ghostly encounters, this was just so haunted. No matter how hard she looked, Nellie only saw darkness. Who knew how deep it went? Who knew how long she would fall if she just tipped over the edge? Nellie didn’t want to tip over the edge, but what a way to go, right? Falling into some Amityville-style Hell portal. They would get so many views.  

“How about less leaning over the death hole and more reading from the guidebook?” Devi suggested.

Nellie pulled out the book, distracted by the darkness in front of her.

“Okay, so, while Bradford might have preferred to keep the séance room secure in the case terrible dark forces got out, his kids used this room for more… private party activities.”

“You are not suggesting that this hole is the result of violent 1970s sex, are you?” West laughed.

“No, apparently the damage originated on the ground floor, in the main séance room,” Nellie said, frowning as she read. “That doesn’t quite make sense. The giant hole is up here.”

“An earthquake at the time caused structural damage to a lot of the mansion, and is said to have upset some poorly made support beams that collapsed, making the center of the floor collapse,” Devi said. “But some people think there was an explosion of dark energy after a séance went wrong, and the explosion caused the hole. It was in the papers. And my mom remembered it.”

“Doesn’t look burnt…” Nellie murmured as she touched the edge of the green carpet, torn and drooping towards the darkness below.

“Maybe dark energy doesn’t burn,” West said. “Most of the dark energy we’ve faced has been cold.”

“I don’t trust you two to keep your balance,” Devi said, cutting off their speculation. “Come on. We’ve leaving.”

&quot;Not now, West,&quot; Nellie said, but it did not come out quite as sharp as she intended. 

This wasn&#39;t the first time she had kept a little sourvenier from a haunt, but she had never grabbed one so quickly before. The ribbon felt like it was burning a hole in her pocket. She supposed she could turn back and put it in the cabinet again, but how would she explain that to Devi and West? How would West react? She couldn&#39;t handle his mockery, not when she was already feeling guilty. 

&quot;Nellie?&quot; Devi asked, and Nellie realized she had been standing in silence, the red light of the camera waiting for action. &quot;There are still a lot of rooms to-&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t have all night to explore,&quot; Nellie said, cutting her off with a grin. &quot;Let&#39;s just keep going.&quot;

Like looking at pictures of her swollen throat at the doctor’s office after the bad bulimia episode. An inside view that should never be outside.

“Looks like a bathroom,” said West, nodding officially to himself.

Nellie opened the guidebook, if anything for an excuse to look away from the pink.

“Says here that it’s specifically the Girls’ Bathroom,” she said.

“Like, a gendered bathroom for parties?” West asked. “Is there a boys’ bathroom somewhere?”

“No, one sec,” said Nellie, skimming the chunk of text. “It was used for the public who came for parties or Bradford’s more intimate get-togethers, but privately, it was for the girls to use. The daughters and the wives.”

“Wives, multiple?” West asked.

“Yeah, I guess, there’s not anymore info on that on this page, but I did know he was a misogynistic creep,” Nellie said, flipping through the book before settling back on her page. “Okay, so the five girls, um, women I mean, Bradford&#39;s three lovers and two daughters would use this bathroom and it led to a lot of drama, blah, blah, blah-”

“Fascinating stuff, Nellie,” said West. 

“In conclusion, it’s a bathroom, and it was themed for the girls,” Nellie said, snapping the book shut.

“There’s no boy-themed bathroom, if you’re wondering,” Devi quietly added, making both Nellie and West jump from her sudden presence behind them. “Bradford and his son had private bathrooms connected to their bedrooms. But there was an issue with the plumbing about ten years ago and they got wrecked. The owner sealed them shut. So if you want bathroom footage, now’s the time.”

It smelled almost like… chicken soup? She had to assume that the smell was coming from the brown goop congealed around the tub’s plug.

“Are you going to touch it?” asked West.

“Don’t touch it,” said Devi.

“I’m not going to touch it!” Nellie snapped.

She kind of wanted to, though. It was like the smell. It attracted and repulsed her. A bad memory of childhood sickness that you could never forget.

“Don’t think we have time for that, Nel,” West mumbled.

“What the Hell, West?” Nellie snapped at him, but if West’s continued mumbles were an apology, she did not care.

“And you two were doing so well at getting along,” Devi sighed.

“Did you hear… Whatever,” Nellie said, deflating a little though she knew she was as pink as the room. “Screw you, West.”

“Devi!” Nellie gasped and West chuckled with her.

“I just mean… this place has a reputation and that’s a medicine cabinet.”

“And when a place has a reputation like this one does, you’re not going to find any remnants of a fun time fifty years after the party ended,” Nellie joked. “Actually, you probably wouldn’t find anything halfway through the party. The Benningtons went hard. But…”

Nellie pulled a white ribbon out of the cabinet. It was carefully wound, but Nellie did not think twice before unwinding it to its full length.

“Thrilling,” West said dryly.

“Ribbons were big in the 70s,” Devi said, a faint smile on her lips. “Like The Cars’ song. &#39;Perfume... ribbons.. etc...’”

Nellie hummed the tune to the song, rocking a bit to an imaginary beat.

“Did you get that?” she asked and West gave a thumbs up.

As her crew left the bathroom, Nellie tucked the ribbon into her pocket.

The brown sludge seemed to originate from under a door at the far end of the room that was nailed shut with large pieces of wood, the freshest items in the room. Everything else, from the soggy remains of poster drooping from nails in the wall, to the marshy remains of a bedspread on the once proud and now rotting wooden frame, had been taken over by the sludge.

“West, camera on me, we’re going to be quick about this,” Nellie said, flipping through the guidebook until she found the page for Mark, reading quickly as she trusted the red light was on. “Mark was the second son and biggest disappointment of Bradford’s three children. Oh damn, it actually says that. He had little interest in his father’s occult activities and Bradford’s lovers encouraged him to find a life outside of their strange home. He found that life, but tended to bring it back home, which led to the numerous photos of rockstars and celebrities in the hall. Apparently Mark was an amateur musician himself and his guitar is… you know what, I’m going to assume it rotted. Anyway, he often mocked his father for his beliefs in spirits and demonic forces, and would bad-mouth him to the press who loved the father-son drama. Several times Bradford tried to cut him off, kick him out, but someone else in his family always let him back in whenever he hit rock bottom. Which was often. One night, this is from a police report, one night his sisters both heard their father and brother yelling at each other from… hm, from Bradford’s bedroom or from the kitchen, they couldn’t agree which was one of the reasons why they couldn’t convict… getting ahead of myself. Bradford was screaming at Mark to get out of the house, that this time he had to leave for good, and the next morning Mark was gone. But not left, vanished. And then Bradford had the whole garden redone, new earth put in, oooh the press claimed Bradford killed him and buried him on the property. Some investigators claim they can hear sounds like muffled screams when they walk through the garden, pounding like it’s coming from beneath their feet. It’s been suggested he was buried alive and oh my god I can’t take the smell anymore.”

She could see, not a woman, but the movement of the woman, rushing across the room in desperate, jerky motions, gouging deep into the walls with broken fingernails to make those jagged scratches, chewing on the bedposts, leaving those crushed bits of costume jewellery on the floor. It was not the most harrowing part of the room, but Nellie could not take her eyes of the jewellery, those broken bits of plastic, the tones still so bright despite the years and the decay. Surely, a Bennington daughter could have afforded better? Maybe she bought it outside her allowance. Maybe it was a gift. Sentimental value. 

“Do you think someone stole the sheets?” West asked.

“Oh, you don’t know the legend about Dawn!” Devi gasped.

“We have established that, no, I don’t know the legend,” West said before mumbling. “Don’t think I want to, but I’m sure I’ll learn it soon enough.”

Nellie flipped through the book, forcing suddenly heavy fingers to find the page, keeping her drooping lids open. It would be easy to sleep in this room, even on that stripped bed with no sheets. 

“Dawn was Bradford’s oldest daughter. She grew up in Mississippi with her mother, one of Bradford’s lovers, the one who apparently encouraged him to build this house for the whole family. The press described her as a Southern Belle, or a Peach Flower forced to live as a Cactus. She was sweet to her friends and family but downright prickly to anyone who came courting. Ha. ‘Came courting.’ However, rumor has it that she did fall in love, and not with one of those rich Hollywood types that were always shmoozing with Bradford on the estate or cozying up to her brother with their wild lives. She met a folksinger named Emma who snuck into one of their parties because she heard that Janis Ian was there. Emma didn’t meet Janis, but she did meet Dawn. They kept their relationship a secret because they were worried how Dawn’s family would react, with Emma not being rich or previously approved by Bradford as a romantic interest. Then Dawn’s brother Mark did find out, and he told her father, and her father forbade Dawn from ever seeing Emma again. Some say he arranged for Emma to be murdered, or sacrificed her to a dark spirit in order to ensure the continued wealth of the family… okay, I can’t tell if it would ensure their wealth as a kind of payment from the dark spirit in return for the sacrifice or by forcing Dawn to marry someone wealthier who could add to the family… Wait, doesn’t matter anyway because Dawn committed suicide. Later, her sister Tara would tell the police that she thought she heard Dawn come into her room in the middle of the night, and felt her gently kiss her on the forehead before she left. Oh. She took the sheets from her bed, went to the Upper Séance room, and hanged herself.”

“Nel, did you need a sec? Or a tissue?” West asked, surprisingly genuine.

“No,” Nellie said. “It’s just… dusty.”

“Yes, Nellie, obviously.”

The room was very dark. It was sandwiched between the hall and Dawn’s room, so there were no porthole windows to let in the scant starlight that lit the rest of the house. But even in the dull glow of the camera’s light, it was clear that this room had been spared the years of rot and disrepair they had seen elsewhere in the mansion. The bed even looked freshly made, turned down, ready for an occupant to slip inside. There was a teddy bear on a pillow, and though one could have described it as “worn,” Nellie just thought it looked “loved.”

“You should get in the bed,” West whispered.

“I am not getting in the bed,” Nellie whispered back.

“Guys, please don’t whisper,” Devi sighed. “The mics won’t pick you up if you keep whispering.”

“Sorry, Devi,” said Nellie, flipping to Tara’s page in the guidebook. “Okay. This room belonged to Tara. Bradford’s youngest. Younger than her brother Mark by ten years. She moved into the house when she was thirteen, and though her mother tried to keep them separate, Bradford immediately inducted her into the world of dark arts. They would spend hours, damn, sometimes days in his secret study, conducting all sorts of evil magic and communing with dark forces. She was known to have fits of demonic possession during public get togethers, though her siblings insisted she performed these tricks because she was incredibly shy and it was an easy way to get back to her room or the library or to hide with her mom who also hated social events. After her siblings died and Bradford’s lovers abandoned him, Tara stayed, taking care of her father well into his old age. She was supposedly at his side when he died, and he told her a terrible secret, so terrible that she fled, never to be seen again. Bradford’s body was found months after his demise by police on a wellness check. Tara’s body was never found, but foul play was never suspected. Against Tara. There were some rumors that she killed Bradford as revenge for her siblings’ misfortunes, or out of resentment for all the work with evil spirits he made her do. And in occult circles, people say she killed him to absorb his power so it wouldn’t be wasted in his death. So either a tragic figure, or a really evil figure. Maybe she’s paying some poor bound spirit to keep her room clean in case she ever returns.”

“Is that in the book?” asked Devi.

“No, that’s a Nellie original.”

“Don’t touch anything, even if you think it would be hilarious, this place looks toxic,” Devi said, hand covering her nose and mouth. “The owner said the men’s bathrooms were… well I was not prepared for this.”

“West, camera on me, we’re going to be quick about this,” Nellie said, flipping through the guidebook until she found the page for Mark, reading quickly as she trusted the red light was on. “Mark was the second son and biggest disappointment of Bradford’s three children. Oh damn, it actually says that. He had little interest in his father’s occult activities and Bradford’s lovers encouraged him to find a life outside of their strange home. He found that life, but tended to bring it back home, which led to the numerous photos of rockstars and celebrities in the hall. Apparently Mark was an amateur musician himself and his guitar is… you know what, I’m going to assume it rotted. Anyway, he often mocked his father for his beliefs in spirits and demonic forces, and would bad-mouth him to the press who loved the father-son drama. Several times Bradford tried to cut him off, kick him out, but someone else in his family always let him back in whenever he hit rock bottom. Which was often. One night, this is from a police report, one night his sisters both heard their father and brother yelling at each other from… hm, from Bradford’s bedroom or from the kitchen, they couldn’t agree which was one of the reasons why they couldn’t convict… getting ahead of myself. Bradford was screaming at Mark to get out of the house, that this time he had to leave for good, and the next morning Mark was gone. But not left, vanished. And then Bradford had the whole garden redone, new earth put in, oooh the press claimed Bradford killed him and buried him on the property. Some investigators claim they can hear sounds like muffled screams when they walk through the garden, pounding like it’s coming from beneath their feet. It’s been suggested he was buried alive and oh my god I can’t take the smell anymore.”

She could see, not a woman, but the movement of the woman, rushing across the room in desperate, jerky motions, gouging deep into the walls with broken fingernails to make those jagged scratches, chewing on the bedposts, leaving those crushed bits of costume jewellery on the floor. It was not the most harrowing part of the room, but Nellie could not take her eyes of the jewellery, those broken bits of plastic, the tones still so bright despite the years and the decay. Surely, a Bennington daughter could have afforded better? Maybe she bought it outside her allowance. Maybe it was a gift. Sentimental value. 

“Do you think someone stole the sheets?” West asked.

“Oh, you don’t know the legend about Dawn!” Devi gasped.

“We have established that, no, I don’t know the legend,” West said before mumbling. “Don’t think I want to, but I’m sure I’ll learn it soon enough.”

Nellie flipped through the book, forcing suddenly heavy fingers to find the page, keeping her drooping lids open. It would be easy to sleep in this room, even on that stripped bed with no sheets. 

“Dawn was Bradford’s oldest daughter. She grew up in Mississippi with her mother, one of Bradford’s lovers, the one who apparently encouraged him to build this house for the whole family. The press described her as a Southern Belle, or a Peach Flower forced to live as a Cactus. She was sweet to her friends and family but downright prickly to anyone who came courting. Ha. ‘Came courting.’ However, rumor has it that she did fall in love, and not with one of those rich Hollywood types that were always shmoozing with Bradford on the estate or cozying up to her brother with their wild lives. She met a folksinger named Emma who snuck into one of their parties because she heard that Janis Ian was there. Emma didn’t meet Janis, but she did meet Dawn. They kept their relationship a secret because they were worried how Dawn’s family would react, with Emma not being rich or previously approved by Bradford as a romantic interest. Then Dawn’s brother Mark did find out, and he told her father, and her father forbade Dawn from ever seeing Emma again. Some say he arranged for Emma to be murdered, or sacrificed her to a dark spirit in order to ensure the continued wealth of the family… okay, I can’t tell if it would ensure their wealth as a kind of payment from the dark spirit in return for the sacrifice or by forcing Dawn to marry someone wealthier who could add to the family… Wait, doesn’t matter anyway because Dawn committed suicide. Later, her sister Tara would tell the police that she thought she heard Dawn come into her room in the middle of the night, and felt her gently kiss her on the forehead before she left. Oh. She took the sheets from her bed, went to the Upper Séance room, and hanged herself.”

“Nel, did you need a sec? Or a tissue?” West asked, surprisingly genuine.

“No,” Nellie said. “It’s just… dusty.”

“Yes, Nellie, obviously.”

The room was very dark. It was sandwiched between the hall and Dawn’s room, so there were no porthole windows to let in the scant starlight that lit the rest of the house. But even in the dull glow of the camera’s light, it was clear that this room had been spared the years of rot and disrepair they had seen elsewhere in the mansion. The bed even looked freshly made, turned down, ready for an occupant to slip inside. There was a teddy bear on a pillow, and though one could have described it as “worn,” Nellie just thought it looked “loved.”

“You should get in the bed,” West whispered.

“I am not getting in the bed,” Nellie whispered back.

“Guys, please don’t whisper,” Devi sighed. “The mics won’t pick you up if you keep whispering.”

“Sorry, Devi,” said Nellie, flipping to Tara’s page in the guidebook. “Okay. This room belonged to Tara. Bradford’s youngest. Younger than her brother Mark by ten years. She moved into the house when she was thirteen, and though her mother tried to keep them separate, Bradford immediately inducted her into the world of dark arts. They would spend hours, damn, sometimes days in his secret study, conducting all sorts of evil magic and communing with dark forces. She was known to have fits of demonic possession during public get togethers, though her siblings insisted she performed these tricks because she was incredibly shy and it was an easy way to get back to her room or the library or to hide with her mom who also hated social events. After her siblings died and Bradford’s lovers abandoned him, Tara stayed, taking care of her father well into his old age. She was supposedly at his side when he died, and he told her a terrible secret, so terrible that she fled, never to be seen again. Bradford’s body was found months after his demise by police on a wellness check. Tara’s body was never found, but foul play was never suspected. Against Tara. There were some rumors that she killed Bradford as revenge for her siblings’ misfortunes, or out of resentment for all the work with evil spirits he made her do. And in occult circles, people say she killed him to absorb his power so it wouldn’t be wasted in his death. So either a tragic figure, or a really evil figure. Maybe she’s paying some poor bound spirit to keep her room clean in case she ever returns.”

“Is that in the book?” asked Devi.

“No, that’s a Nellie original.”

“No, that’s a Nellie original.”

“Wait,” said Devi, crouching to look at a little box on the ground, no bigger than a box for a ring, with nine sliding tiles on the top. “There’s some kind of puzzle here.”

“No, I see numbers, that counts as math,” Nellie protested. “We’re going to the next room.”

“No,” Nellie said. “It’s just… dusty.” 

Nellie paused. There was something sticking out of the vanity’s top drawer. She tugged it free, reading the faded lines.

“Hey, guys, I think I found a poem.”

“Give a dead woman some privacy, Nellie,” said West. “We should go on.”

[[Dawn&#39;s Poem - Nellie&#39;s Tour (Cont. from Groove Room with Ribbon)]]

She had a “Beast’s Gift for Belle” idea of libraries, a little whimsy and fantasy, vaguely French in an animated kind of way, big windows, big curtains, big ladders to ride across the bookshelves while singing away the pain. The Bennington Mansion library had none of those things. It had severity. If you sang in here, someone, something, would surely come to shut you up.

“Is that sludge or a choice?” West asked at Nellie&#39;s shoulder.

She followed his camera up. The ceiling came to a point, painted all the same black or dark brown, and while it did look wet, fresh, it wasn’t dripping. It reminded Nellie of the entry room ceiling, reversed. All darkness where that was all light. Everything hidden from the moon. She noted that there weren’t any porthole windows in this room either, the only light dimly edging in from the hallway. A beam of light disrupted the darkness.
“Probably could have used this earlier, but I wanted to save the battery,” said Devi.

Nellie followed Devi’s light as she slowly panned across the depressing room, illuminating bookshelves still filled with books, some rotting, some holding up surprisingly well. The sofa’s, black leather ones that filled the room with a musky smell that was exactly unpleasant, sat low to the ground, cautious, creating a kind of hedge maze path across the sprawling room. Nellie felt an urge to climb on top of them, over them like a child. 

“The floor is lava,” she said to herself and heard West chuckle politely, his camera following the light across the sofas as well. 

There was a blinding moment as the light caught on a large globe, the only thing in the room that looked a little like what Nellie had expected, a little bit of wonder in its golden-hued frame and perhaps hand-painted countries. It tilted at an odd, unearthly angle, but was still quite elegant. A tapestry hung behind it, but the corner had come undone and the black fabric folded in on itself, covering whatever image had once been proudly on display. 

Devi stopped the light at the far end of the room, where a similar archway led further into the mansion, bringing them closer to their final destination. Next to it, a winding staircase of a solid black material that looked surprisingly like plastic led to an upper floor. 

“Well,” said Nellie. “There’s a lot going on here. I feel like libraries are made to be haunted. Keep that camera on me, West.”

Everything else, from the soggy remains of poster drooping from nails in the wall, to the marshy remains of a bedspread on the once proud and now rotting wooden frame, had been taken over by the sludge.

“West, camera on me, we’re going to be quick about this,” Nellie said, flipping through the guidebook until she found the page for Mark, reading quickly as she trusted the red light was on. “Mark was the second son and biggest disappointment of Bradford’s three children. Oh damn, it actually says that. He had little interest in his father’s occult activities and Bradford’s lovers encouraged him to find a life outside of their strange home. He found that life, but tended to bring it back home, which led to the numerous photos of rockstars and celebrities in the hall. Apparently Mark was an amateur musician himself and his guitar is… you know what, I’m going to assume it rotted. Anyway, he often mocked his father for his beliefs in spirits and demonic forces, and would bad-mouth him to the press who loved the father-son drama. Several times Bradford tried to cut him off, kick him out, but someone else in his family always let him back in whenever he hit rock bottom. Which was often. One night, this is from a police report, one night his sisters both heard their father and brother yelling at each other from… hm, from Bradford’s bedroom or from the kitchen, they couldn’t agree which was one of the reasons why they couldn’t convict… getting ahead of myself. Bradford was screaming at Mark to get out of the house, that this time he had to leave for good, and the next morning Mark was gone. But not left, vanished. And then Bradford had the whole garden redone, new earth put in, oooh the press claimed Bradford killed him and buried him on the property. Some investigators claim they can hear sounds like muffled screams when they walk through the garden, pounding like it’s coming from beneath their feet. It’s been suggested he was buried alive and oh my god I can’t take the smell anymore.”

West frowned as he stared at piece of the bedframe that had not completely rotted.

“There’s some kind of message scratched on here,” West said, leaning down to read it more closely.

Anyway, he often mocked his father for his beliefs in spirits and demonic forces, and would bad-mouth him to the press who loved the father-son drama. Several times Bradford tried to cut him off, kick him out, but someone else in his family always let him back in whenever he hit rock bottom. Which was often. One night, this is from a police report, one night his sisters both heard their father and brother yelling at each other from… hm, from Bradford’s bedroom or from the kitchen, they couldn’t agree which was one of the reasons why they couldn’t convict… getting ahead of myself. Bradford was screaming at Mark to get out of the house, that this time he had to leave for good, and the next morning Mark was gone. But not left, vanished. And then Bradford had the whole garden redone, new earth put in, oooh the press claimed Bradford killed him and buried him on the property. Some investigators claim they can hear sounds like muffled screams when they walk through the garden, pounding like it’s coming from beneath their feet. It’s been suggested he was buried alive and oh my god I can’t take the smell anymore.”

West frowned as he stared at piece of the bedframe that had not completely rotted.

“There’s some kind of message scratched on here,” West said, leaning down to read it more closely.

“West, do not touch the rotten wood,” Devi chided. “Let’s go.”

[[Mark&#39;s Message - Nellie&#39;s Tour (Cont. from Groove Room with Ribbon)]]

She could see, not a woman, but the movement of the woman, rushing across the room in desperate, jerky motions, gouging deep into the walls with broken fingernails to make those jagged scratches, chewing on the bedposts, leaving those crushed bits of costume jewellery on the floor. It was not the most harrowing part of the room, but Nellie could not take her eyes of the jewellery, those broken bits of plastic, the tones still so bright despite the years and the decay. Surely, a Bennington daughter could have afforded better? Maybe she bought it outside her allowance. Maybe it was a gift. Sentimental value. 

“Do you think someone stole the sheets?” West asked.

“Oh, you don’t know the legend about Dawn!” Devi gasped.

“We have established that, no, I don’t know the legend,” West said before mumbling. “Don’t think I want to, but I’m sure I’ll learn it soon enough.”

Nellie flipped through the book, forcing suddenly heavy fingers to find the page, keeping her drooping lids open. It would be easy to sleep in this room, even on that stripped bed with no sheets. 

“Dawn was Bradford’s oldest daughter. She grew up in Mississippi with her mother, one of Bradford’s lovers, the one who apparently encouraged him to build this house for the whole family. The press described her as a Southern Belle, or a Peach Flower forced to live as a Cactus. She was sweet to her friends and family but downright prickly to anyone who came courting. Ha. ‘Came courting.’ However, rumor has it that she did fall in love, and not with one of those rich Hollywood types that were always shmoozing with Bradford on the estate or cozying up to her brother with their wild lives. She met a folksinger named Emma who snuck into one of their parties because she heard that Janis Ian was there. Emma didn’t meet Janis, but she did meet Dawn. They kept their relationship a secret because they were worried how Dawn’s family would react, with Emma not being rich or previously approved by Bradford as a romantic interest. Then Dawn’s brother Mark did find out, and he told her father, and her father forbade Dawn from ever seeing Emma again. Some say he arranged for Emma to be murdered, or sacrificed her to a dark spirit in order to ensure the continued wealth of the family… okay, I can’t tell if it would ensure their wealth as a kind of payment from the dark spirit in return for the sacrifice or by forcing Dawn to marry someone wealthier who could add to the family… Wait, doesn’t matter anyway because Dawn committed suicide. Later, her sister Tara would tell the police that she thought she heard Dawn come into her room in the middle of the night, and felt her gently kiss her on the forehead before she left. Oh. She took the sheets from her bed, went to the Upper Séance room, and hanged herself.”

“Nel, did you need a sec? Or a tissue?” West asked, surprisingly genuine.

“No,” Nellie said. “It’s just… dusty.” 

Nellie paused. There was something sticking out of the vanity’s top drawer. She tugged it free, reading the faded lines.

“Hey, guys, I think I found a poem.”

“Give a dead woman some privacy, Nellie,” said West. “We should go on.”

[[Dawn&#39;s Poem - Nellie&#39;s Tour (Cont. with Ribbon)]]

“Yes, Nellie, obviously.”

The room was very dark. It was sandwiched between the hall and Dawn’s room, so there were no porthole windows to let in the scant starlight that lit the rest of the house. But even in the dull glow of the camera’s light, it was clear that this room had been spared the years of rot and disrepair they had seen elsewhere in the mansion. The bed even looked freshly made, turned down, ready for an occupant to slip inside. There was a teddy bear on a pillow, and though one could have described it as “worn,” Nellie just thought it looked “loved.”

“You should get in the bed,” West whispered.

“I am not getting in the bed,” Nellie whispered back.

“Guys, please don’t whisper,” Devi sighed. “The mics won’t pick you up if you keep whispering.”

“Sorry, Devi,” said Nellie, flipping to Tara’s page in the guidebook. “Okay. This room belonged to Tara. Bradford’s youngest. Younger than her brother Mark by ten years. She moved into the house when she was thirteen, and though her mother tried to keep them separate, Bradford immediately inducted her into the world of dark arts. They would spend hours, damn, sometimes days in his secret study, conducting all sorts of evil magic and communing with dark forces. She was known to have fits of demonic possession during public get togethers, though her siblings insisted she performed these tricks because she was incredibly shy and it was an easy way to get back to her room or the library or to hide with her mom who also hated social events. After her siblings died and Bradford’s lovers abandoned him, Tara stayed, taking care of her father well into his old age. She was supposedly at his side when he died, and he told her a terrible secret, so terrible that she fled, never to be seen again. Bradford’s body was found months after his demise by police on a wellness check. Tara’s body was never found, but foul play was never suspected. Against Tara. There were some rumors that she killed Bradford as revenge for her siblings’ misfortunes, or out of resentment for all the work with evil spirits he made her do. And in occult circles, people say she killed him to absorb his power so it wouldn’t be wasted in his death. So either a tragic figure, or a really evil figure. Maybe she’s paying some poor bound spirit to keep her room clean in case she ever returns.”

“Is that in the book?” asked Devi.

“No, that’s a Nellie original.”

“Wait,” said Devi, crouching to look at a little box on the ground, no bigger than a box for a ring, with nine sliding tiles on the top. “There’s some kind of puzzle here.”

“No, I see numbers, that counts as math,” Nellie protested. “We’re going to the next room.”

[[Tara&#39;s Puzzle - Nellie&#39;s Tour (Cont. with Ribbon)]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="70" name="Library - Nellie&#39;s Tour (Cont. with Ribbon)" tags="" position="375,925" size="100,100">Nellie walked through an ornate archway into a library that was nothing like she expected. She had a “Beast’s Gift for Belle” idea of libraries, a little whimsy and fantasy, vaguely French in an animated kind of way, big windows, big curtains, big ladders to ride across the bookshelves while singing away the pain. The Bennington Mansion library had none of those things. It had severity. If you sang in here, someone, something, would surely come to shut you up.

“Is that sludge or a choice?” West asked at Nellie&#39;s shoulder.

She followed his camera up. The ceiling came to a point, painted all the same black or dark brown, and while it did look wet, fresh, it wasn’t dripping. It reminded Nellie of the entry room ceiling, reversed. All darkness where that was all light. Everything hidden from the moon. She noted that there weren’t any porthole windows in this room either, the only light dimly edging in from the hallway. A beam of light disrupted the darkness.
“Probably could have used this earlier, but I wanted to save the battery,” said Devi.

Nellie followed Devi’s light as she slowly panned across the depressing room, illuminating bookshelves still filled with books, some rotting, some holding up surprisingly well. The sofa’s, black leather ones that filled the room with a musky smell that was exactly unpleasant, sat low to the ground, cautious, creating a kind of hedge maze path across the sprawling room. Nellie felt an urge to climb on top of them, over them like a child. 

“The floor is lava,” she said to herself and heard West chuckle politely, his camera following the light across the sofas as well. 

There was a blinding moment as the light caught on a large globe, the only thing in the room that looked a little like what Nellie had expected, a little bit of wonder in its golden-hued frame and perhaps hand-painted countries. It tilted at an odd, unearthly angle, but was still quite elegant. A tapestry hung behind it, but the corner had come undone and the black fabric folded in on itself, covering whatever image had once been proudly on display. 

Devi stopped the light at the far end of the room, where a similar archway led further into the mansion, bringing them closer to their final destination. Next to it, a winding staircase of a solid black material that looked surprisingly like plastic led to an upper floor. 

“Well,” said Nellie. “There’s a lot going on here. I feel like libraries are made to be haunted. Keep that camera on me, West.”

The brown sludge seemed to originate from under a door at the far end of the room that was nailed shut with large pieces of wood, the freshest items in the room. Everything else, from the soggy remains of poster drooping from nails in the wall, to the marshy remains of a bedspread on the once proud and now rotting wooden frame, had been taken over by the sludge.

“Don’t touch anything, even if you think it would be hilarious, this place looks toxic,” Devi said, hand covering her nose and mouth. “The owner said the men’s bathrooms were… well I was not prepared for this.”

“West, camera on me, we’re going to be quick about this,” Nellie said, flipping through the guidebook until she found the page for Mark, reading quickly as she trusted the red light was on. “Mark was the second son and biggest disappointment of Bradford’s three children. Oh damn, it actually says that. He had little interest in his father’s occult activities and Bradford’s lovers encouraged him to find a life outside of their strange home. He found that life, but tended to bring it back home, which led to the numerous photos of rockstars and celebrities in the hall. Apparently Mark was an amateur musician himself and his guitar is… you know what, I’m going to assume it rotted. Anyway, he often mocked his father for his beliefs in spirits and demonic forces, and would bad-mouth him to the press who loved the father-son drama. Several times Bradford tried to cut him off, kick him out, but someone else in his family always let him back in whenever he hit rock bottom. Which was often. One night, this is from a police report, one night his sisters both heard their father and brother yelling at each other from… hm, from Bradford’s bedroom or from the kitchen, they couldn’t agree which was one of the reasons why they couldn’t convict… getting ahead of myself. Bradford was screaming at Mark to get out of the house, that this time he had to leave for good, and the next morning Mark was gone. But not left, vanished. And then Bradford had the whole garden redone, new earth put in, oooh the press claimed Bradford killed him and buried him on the property. Some investigators claim they can hear sounds like muffled screams when they walk through the garden, pounding like it’s coming from beneath their feet. It’s been suggested he was buried alive and oh my god I can’t take the smell anymore.”

West frowned as he stared at piece of the bedframe that had not completely rotted.

For a moment she thought it was because it was a little broken, that its odd angle was the result of damage from time or vandals or other ghostly investigators who weren’t exactly respectful. Then she suddenly remembered something, a scene in some mobster movie that always struck her as needlessly fancy.

“Nellie, don’t break the globe,” Devi warned.

“She’s not,” said West.

Nellie popped the top off the globe on its hinge, revealing a collection of glass bottles inside half-filled with suspicious brown liquid.

“Scotch?” West asked.

“I’m not tasting it to find out,” Nellie laughed. “But the crystals’ pretty.”

She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

Nellie stared at the tapestry and felt the hairs rise on the back of her neck. It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns to give the viewers something to focus on. “Do any of the Benningtons have a ‘V’ name?”

“You’re the one with the guidebook,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="78" name="Upper Floor Observatory - Nellie&#39;s Tour" tags="" position="375,925" size="100,100">“Wow.”

Nellie, Devi, and West looked up at the ceiling, the glass a continuation from the entry room ceiling, which Nellie thought didn’t make sense with the blueprint but she had been warned the mansion would be confusing. If she had read the guidebook more closely, perhaps she could have pictured it better in her head. And she wasn’t all that worried about picturing it. She was invested in her current view.

Maybe the clouds had passed, or maybe it was the occult magic of the Bennington mansion, but Nellie could have sworn that there were not so many stars in the sky when they drove up. That the moon wasn’t so full. It made her feel like crying. It made her feel small and unimportant.

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West.

Nellie could see the shadowed shapes of beds around her, elegant little boxy things with elegant little boxy side tables, but it was hard to care too much about what was in this room when she could look at what was above it. 

“Hey, Nellie, you’ve been standing there awhile,” Devi said, giving her should a gentle tap or tug.

Nellie made sure her smile didn’t fade for the camera as she pulled her gaze away from the stars to the few items still left in a room that had been mostly cleared out. 

“What does the guidebook say?” asked West.

Nellie squinted at the pages.

“I should have read this on the stairs,” said Nellie. “It’s definitely a bedroom. Wait, it’s definitely an observatory. Okay, it definitely belonged to the lovers who used it as… yep, a bedroom and an observatory, it was the observatory first, they took it for themselves to not sleep with Bradford after one of the kids died and the romance died too, and the observatory was good for occult stuff-”

“Stop saying ‘observatory,’” said West. “Let’s just look around or something. Enjoy the view for a bit.”

“What is it, Nel?” West asked, hurrying over with the camera.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

“No sludge?” asked Devi, smirking. 

“No sludge,” Nellie agreed. 

She pulled out one of the books, with a picture of Nancy crouching behind a staircase still mostly visible on the cover. 

“Reading isn’t really captivating TV,” West said.

“Shh, it’s good for the soul,” Nellie grinned, but her smile dropped.

There was something on the shelf, tucked behind the books, glinting in the light of Devi’s flashlight. Nellie did not know what it was yet, but still, she wanted it more than anything, she wanted it to be hers and hers alone. She reached for the sparkling object and tugged it free. A locket on a thin gold chain, warm in her hand. The only warm thing in the world.

“You’re shivering again Nel,” said West. 

“What is that?” Devi asked.

“It’s mine,” Nellie snapped, then she shook her head, smiling a weak apology at Devi. “It’s a locket. Just a trinket. Costume jewellery. Not worth anything… I’m going to keep it.”

“You okay, Nel?” West asked. “You look-”

“Leave me alone, West!” 

Nellie clutched the locket close, considered, then lifted the chain over her head. The locket slipped down the inside of her turtleneck, sliding against her skin, so warm she could barely feel it. Like fingertips along her sternum. Compared to the warmth of the locket, the library had never felt colder. 

“Let’s get out of here,” said Nellie.

“You don’t want to explore anymore?” Devi asked.

“It’s freezing,” said Nellie, shaking her head. “I need… We need to go.”

Nellie was shivering still, but she shook her head. 

“Continuity,” she said. “I’ll survive. We just need to… keep looking around. Film. Stuff.”

Nellie pretended not to see Devi and West share a concerned glance. They had too much to do, and she only had enough energy to try to keep walking with making her trembling too obvious. The locket was not warm enough to ease the chill of the house. She wished she had worn a thicker turtleneck. She didn’t care if it would ruin the audio. Her chattering teeth might do that anyway. She tried to ignore the cold that settled into her bones and focus on the room. 

Nellie was expecting something a little more sinister from a man who made the papers for claiming to have accessed uncharted netherworlds full of nightmares beyond our comprehension, but she supposed those pursuits were best left to the young. Or at least left in the past with flared jeans and sequin tops. When life came at you hard and fast, or the illusion of fast after decades of smoking cigars and ignoring the persistent cough that came with it, you didn’t have time for spirits and demons anymore. 

Maybe at one point there was a stately wooden bed or some hyper-modern monstrosity of a bed, but all that was left in the room was one of those hospital-style rolling gurneys. A fancy one, wider and with deeper cushions than anything Nellie saw at her grandmother’s nursing home, but if you didn’t know expensive hospital equipment you wouldn’t have been impressed. 

“Guidebook?” West asked.

“There’s nothing for this room,” Nellie said. “Bradford was alive when the tours were happening, but he would stay shut in his room. No one was allowed to see him or come here. Besides, this was his private space.”

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“I think there are some castle tours in Scotland like that,” said Devi.

“Haunted ones?” West asked, perking up. “We should do a trip. Claim it as a business expense.”

“Sure, West, I’ll bet the IRS will love that for us,” Nellie groaned.

There was another door on the far wall, as solid as the front door to the entry room, but this handle turned easily.

“We’ll go to the garden next,” Devi said and Nellie dropped the handle. “We have to cross it to get to the Gallery. And we might see the ghost of Bradford’s son, Mark. If Bradford killed him, amateur sleuths think that’s where he was probably buried. But no body was found so… probably not.”

“It could have been eaten by worms,” Nellie suggested.

“I don’t think worms work that fast,” West countered. “Unless they’re like, ‘Dune’ worms.”

Nellie left the door for later, stepped around a few sunken sections of carpet, and pretended to look thoughtfully at the framed pictures on the wall in case West was filming her. If she looked distressed, it would add to the haunted vibe, she supposed. 
West was filming a wardrobe in the corner, which may have been engraved in violent gouging designs or else it had been beset by gnawing rats at some point. Devi was standing by the hospital bed, looking particularly forlorn. 

“Anything interesting?” Nellie asked, but she couldn’t make her voice quite as enthusiastic as she hoped.

She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

Nellie stared at the tapestry and felt the hairs rise on the back of her neck. It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns to give the viewers something to focus on. “Do any of the Benningtons have a ‘V’ name?”

“You’re the one with the guidebook,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West.

Nellie, Devi, and West looked up at the ceiling, the glass a continuation from the entry room ceiling, which Nellie thought didn’t make sense with the blueprint but she had been warned the mansion would be confusing. If she had read the guidebook more closely, perhaps she could have pictured it better in her head. And she wasn’t all that worried about picturing it. She was invested in her current view.

Maybe the clouds had passed, or maybe it was the occult magic of the Bennington mansion, but Nellie could have sworn that there were not so many stars in the sky when they drove up. That the moon wasn’t so full. It made her feel like crying. It made her feel small and unimportant.

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West.

Nellie could see the shadowed shapes of beds around her, elegant little boxy things with elegant little boxy side tables, but it was hard to care too much about what was in this room when she could look at what was above it. 

“Hey, Nellie, you’ve been standing there awhile,” Devi said, giving her should a gentle tap or tug.

Nellie made sure her smile didn’t fade for the camera as she pulled her gaze away from the stars to the few items still left in a room that had been mostly cleared out. 

“What does the guidebook say?” asked West.

Nellie squinted at the pages.

“I should have read this on the stairs,” said Nellie. “It’s definitely a bedroom. Wait, it’s definitely an observatory. Okay, it definitely belonged to the lovers who used it as… yep, a bedroom and an observatory, it was the observatory first, they took it for themselves to not sleep with Bradford after one of the kids died and the romance died too, and the observatory was good for occult stuff-”

“Stop saying ‘observatory,’” said West. “Let’s just look around or something. Enjoy the view for a bit.”

“Nellie, don’t break the globe,” Devi warned.

“She’s not,” said West.

“Stop being so suggestive,” West laughed.

Nellie guessed he could not see her rolling her eyes, but she rolled them anyway.

“Does it work?” Devi asked.

“Can a telescope stop working?” West asked.

“Let’s find out,” said Nellie.

She looked through the telescope and for a moment thought that she had forgotten to check for a lens cap, because all she saw was black. But when she checked, there was no cap. Maybe a telescope could stop working, somehow, but in her gut, she doubted it. She did not understand it, but when she looked through the telescope, all of those beautiful stars disappeared… if they were even there at all. 

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West, already turning the camera away.

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said, reaching into the shadows behind the cube. 

She never would have seen it without the bright moonlight, but there it was, begging her to take it. She lifted up the book, in much better condition than the ones in the library, though the paper was soft against her hands. It wasn’t hardbound. It wasn’t bound at all. It looked like the kind of spiral journal she used to bring to school. 

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary, too quickly for her to catch or get a good look at. West knelt on the ground, but the floor was in rougher shape than they realized, full of cracks and holes. Whatever fell out of the book could have fallen into any of them. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

She saw Devi almost protest as Nellie slipped the book into her bag, then change her mind, letting Nellie lead them down the stairs.

What was left of the pictures, anyway. They had been damaged, not by the sludge and rot that ate most of the walls in the mansion but by what appeared to be aggressive stab wounds. Nellie wandered over to them, touching the pieces before Devi could tell her to keep her hands to herself, trying to pull the shreds back together into something coherent. She could just make out what might have been a wedding photo that had been torn apart. Odd. Didn’t Bradford stay notoriously unmarried? 

“Does anyone see a knife?” asked Nellie.

West was filming a wardrobe in the corner, which may have been engraved in violent gouging designs or else it had been beset by gnawing rats at some point. Devi was standing by the hospital bed, looking particularly forlorn. She must have had some bad hospital memories. Both of the crew members shook their heads.

“That would have been too exciting, I guess,” Nellie sighed, letting the pieces of the picture fall back into disarray. “Does anyone see anything interesting?”

“Stop being so suggestive,” West laughed.

Nellie guessed he could not see her rolling her eyes, but she rolled them anyway.

“Does it work?” Devi asked.

“Can a telescope stop working?” West asked.

“Let’s find out,” said Nellie.

She looked through the telescope and for a moment thought that she had forgotten to check for a lens cap, because all she saw was black. But when she checked, there was no cap. Maybe a telescope could stop working, somehow, but in her gut, she doubted it. She did not understand it, but when she looked through the telescope, all of those beautiful stars disappeared… if they were even there at all. 

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

[[Side Table - Nellie&#39;s Tour]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="100" name="Side Table - Nellie&#39;s Tour" tags="" position="375,925" size="100,100">“Oh great, a cube, how thrilling,” muttered West.

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West, already turning the camera away.

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said, reaching into the shadows behind the cube. 

She never would have seen it without the bright moonlight, but there it was, begging her to take it. She lifted up the book, in much better condition than the ones in the library, though the paper was soft against her hands. It wasn’t hardbound. It wasn’t bound at all. It looked like the kind of spiral journal she used to bring to school. 

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary, too quickly for her to catch or get a good look at. West knelt on the ground, but the floor was in rougher shape than they realized, full of cracks and holes. Whatever fell out of the book could have fallen into any of them. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

&quot;Guys, we&#39;ve barely looked around this part of the house and you&#39;re already...&quot; Devi trailed off, taking deep breaths.

Nellie and West glanced at each other.

&quot;We always take stuff like this for the show,&quot; Nellie said.

&quot;I know,&quot; Devi snapped. &quot;You usually just do a bit more investigating first. There was a whole library downstairs and you came up here-&quot;

&quot;We can still explore the library,&quot; Nellie cut in.

&quot;Or... we could move on?&quot; West suggested. 

Devi didn&#39;t respond, so Nellie nodded for her. It felt wrong to answer for her, but Devi was already shuffling down the stairs. West shrugged his confusion, and they followed her further into the mansion.

[[Bradford&#39;s Bedroom - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Diary)]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="101" name="Globe - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Ribbon)" tags="" position="375,925" size="100,100">Nellie ran her hand along the globe, expecting it to spin and feeling silly when it did not. For a moment she thought it was because it was a little broken, that its odd angle was the result of damage from time or vandals or other ghostly investigators who weren’t exactly respectful. Then she suddenly remembered something, a scene in some mobster movie that always struck her as needlessly fancy.

“Nellie, don’t break the globe,” Devi warned.

“She’s not,” said West.

Nellie popped the top off the globe on its hinge, revealing a collection of glass bottles inside half-filled with suspicious brown liquid.

“Scotch?” West asked.

“I’m not tasting it to find out,” Nellie laughed. “But the crystal’s pretty.”

She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

Nellie stared at the tapestry and felt the hairs rise on the back of her neck. It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns to give the viewers something to focus on. “Do any of the Benningtons have a ‘V’ name?”

“You’re the one with the guidebook,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="103" name="Upper Floor Observatory - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Ribbon)" tags="" position="375,925" size="100,100">“Wow.”

Nellie, Devi, and West looked up at the ceiling, the glass a continuation from the entry room ceiling, which Nellie thought didn’t make sense with the blueprint but she had been warned the mansion would be confusing. If she had read the guidebook more closely, perhaps she could have pictured it better in her head. And she wasn’t all that worried about picturing it. She was invested in her current view.

Maybe the clouds had passed, or maybe it was the occult magic of the Bennington mansion, but Nellie could have sworn that there were not so many stars in the sky when they drove up. That the moon wasn’t so full. It made her feel like crying. It made her feel small and unimportant.

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West.

Nellie could see the shadowed shapes of beds around her, elegant little boxy things with elegant little boxy side tables, but it was hard to care too much about what was in this room when she could look at what was above it. 

“Hey, Nellie, you’ve been standing there awhile,” Devi said, giving her should a gentle tap or tug.

Nellie made sure her smile didn’t fade for the camera as she pulled her gaze away from the stars to the few items still left in a room that had been mostly cleared out. 

“What does the guidebook say?” asked West.

Nellie squinted at the pages.

“I should have read this on the stairs,” said Nellie. “It’s definitely a bedroom. Wait, it’s definitely an observatory. Okay, it definitely belonged to the lovers who used it as… yep, a bedroom and an observatory, it was the observatory first, they took it for themselves to not sleep with Bradford after one of the kids died and the romance died too, and the observatory was good for occult stuff-”

“Stop saying ‘observatory,’” said West. “Let’s just look around or something. Enjoy the view for a bit.”

[[Telescope - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Ribbon)]]

“What is it, Nel?” West asked, hurrying over with the camera.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

“No sludge?” asked Devi, smirking. 

“No sludge,” Nellie agreed. 

She pulled out one of the books, with a picture of Nancy crouching behind a staircase still mostly visible on the cover. 

“Reading isn’t really captivating TV,” West said.

“Shh, it’s good for the soul,” Nellie grinned, but her smile dropped.

There was something on the shelf, tucked behind the books, glinting in the light of Devi’s flashlight. Nellie did not know what it was yet, but still, she wanted it more than anything, she wanted it to be hers and hers alone. She reached for the sparkling object and tugged it free. A locket on a thin gold chain, warm in her hand. The only warm thing in the world.

“You’re shivering again Nel,” said West. 

“What is that?” Devi asked.

“It’s mine,” Nellie snapped, then she shook her head, smiling a weak apology at Devi. “It’s a locket. Just a trinket. Costume jewellery. Not worth anything… I’m going to keep it.”

“You okay, Nel?” West asked. “You look-”

“Leave me alone West!” 

Nellie clutched the locket close, considered, then lifted the chain over her head. The locket slipped down the inside of her turtleneck, sliding against her skin, so warm she could barely feel it. Like fingertips along her sternum. Compared to the warmth of the locket, the library had never felt colder. 

“Let’s get out of here,” said Nellie.

“You don’t want to explore anymore?” Devi asked.

“It’s freezing,” said Nellie, shaking her head. “I need… We need to go.”

Or at least left in the past with flared jeans and sequin tops. When life came at you hard and fast, or the illusion of fast after decades of smoking cigars and ignoring the persistent cough that came with it, you didn’t have time for spirits and demons anymore. 

Maybe at one point there was a stately wooden bed or some hyper-modern monstrosity of a bed, but all that was left in the room was one of those hospital-style rolling gurneys. A fancy one, wider and with deeper cushions than anything Nellie saw at her grandmother’s nursing home, but if you didn’t know expensive hospital equipment you wouldn’t have been impressed. 

“Guidebook?” West asked.

“There’s nothing for this room,” Nellie said. “Bradford was alive when the tours were happening, but he would stay shut in his room. No one was allowed to see him or come here. Besides, this was his private space.”

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“I think there are some castle tours in Scotland like that,” said Devi.

“Haunted ones?” West asked, perking up. “We should do a trip. Claim it as a business expense.”

“Sure, West, I’ll bet the IRS will love that for us,” Nellie groaned.

There was another door on the far wall, as solid as the front door to the entry room, but this handle turned easily.

“We’ll go to the garden next,” Devi said and Nellie dropped the handle. “We have to cross it to get to the Gallery. And we might see the ghost of Bradford’s son, Mark. If Bradford killed him, amateur sleuths think that’s where he was probably buried. But no body was found so… probably not.”

“It could have been eaten by worms,” Nellie suggested.

“I don’t think worms work that fast,” West countered. “Unless they’re like, ‘Dune’ worms.”

Nellie left the door for later, skipped around a few sunken sections of carpet, and decided to look thoughtfully at the framed pictures on the wall in case West got a good shot of her. 

What was left of the pictures, anyway. They had been damaged, not by the sludge and rot that ate most of the walls in the mansion but by what appeared to be aggressive stab wounds. Nellie wandered over to them, touching the pieces before Devi could tell her to keep her hands to herself, trying to pull the shreds back together into something coherent. She could just make out what might have been a wedding photo that had been torn apart. Odd. Didn’t Bradford stay notoriously unmarried? 

“Does anyone see a knife?” asked Nellie.

West was filming a wardrobe in the corner, which may have been engraved in violent gouging designs or else it had been beset by gnawing rats at some point. Devi was standing by the hospital bed, looking particularly forlorn. She must have had some bad hospital memories. Both of the crew members shook their heads.

“That would have been too exciting, I guess,” Nellie sighed, letting the pieces of the picture fall back into disarray. “Does anyone see anything interesting?”

Nellie was shivering still, but she shook her head. 

“Continuity,” she said. “I’ll survive. We just need to… keep looking around. Film. Stuff.”

Nellie pretended not to see Devi and West share a concerned glance. They had too much to do, and she only had enough energy to try to keep walking with making her trembling too obvious. The locket was not warm enough to ease the chill of the house. She wished she had worn a thicker turtleneck. She didn’t care if it would ruin the audio. Her chattering teeth might do that anyway. She tried to ignore the cold that settled into her bones and focus on the room.

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West, already turning the camera away.

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said, reaching into the shadows behind the cube. 
She never would have seen it without the bright moonlight, but there it was, begging her to take it. She lifted up the book, in much better condition than the ones in the library, though the paper was soft against her hands. It wasn’t hardbound. It wasn’t bound at all. It looked like the kind of spiral journal she used to bring to school. 

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary, too quickly for her to catch or get a good look at. West knelt on the ground, but the floor was in rougher shape than they realized, full of cracks and holes. Whatever fell out of the book could have fallen into any of them. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

She saw Devi almost protest as Nellie slipped the book into her bag, then change her mind, letting Nellie lead them down the stairs.

For a moment she thought it was because it was a little broken, that its odd angle was the result of damage from time or vandals or other ghostly investigators who weren’t exactly respectful. Then she suddenly remembered something, a scene in some mobster movie that always struck her as needlessly fancy.

“Nellie, don’t break the globe,” Devi warned.

“She’s not,” said West.

Nellie popped the top off the globe on its hinge, revealing a collection of glass bottles inside half-filled with suspicious brown liquid.

“Scotch?” West asked.

“I’m not tasting it to find out,” Nellie laughed. “But the crystal’s pretty. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

Nellie stared at the tapestry and felt the hairs rise on the back of her neck. It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns to give the viewers something to focus on. “Do any of the Benningtons have a ‘V’ name?”

“You’re the one with the guidebook,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West.

Nellie, Devi, and West looked up at the ceiling, the glass a continuation from the entry room ceiling, which Nellie thought didn’t make sense with the blueprint but she had been warned the mansion would be confusing. If she had read the guidebook more closely, perhaps she could have pictured it better in her head. And she wasn’t all that worried about picturing it. She was invested in her current view.

Maybe the clouds had passed, or maybe it was the occult magic of the Bennington mansion, but Nellie could have sworn that there were not so many stars in the sky when they drove up. That the moon wasn’t so full. It made her feel like crying. It made her feel small and unimportant.

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West.

Nellie could see the shadowed shapes of beds around her, elegant little boxy things with elegant little boxy side tables, but it was hard to care too much about what was in this room when she could look at what was above it. 

“Hey, Nellie, you’ve been standing there awhile,” Devi said, giving her should a gentle tap or tug.

Nellie made sure her smile didn’t fade for the camera as she pulled her gaze away from the stars to the few items still left in a room that had been mostly cleared out. 

“What does the guidebook say?” asked West.

Nellie squinted at the pages.

“I should have read this on the stairs,” said Nellie. “It’s definitely a bedroom. Wait, it’s definitely an observatory. Okay, it definitely belonged to the lovers who used it as… yep, a bedroom and an observatory, it was the observatory first, they took it for themselves to not sleep with Bradford after one of the kids died and the romance died too, and the observatory was good for occult stuff-”

“Stop saying ‘observatory,’” said West. “Let’s just look around or something. Enjoy the view for a bit.”

“What is it, Nel?” West asked, hurrying over with the camera.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

“No sludge?” asked Devi, smirking. 

“No sludge,” Nellie agreed. 

She pulled out one of the books, with a picture of Nancy crouching behind a staircase still mostly visible on the cover. 

“Reading isn’t really captivating TV,” West said.

“Shh, it’s good for the soul,” Nellie grinned, but her smile dropped.

There was something on the shelf, tucked behind the books, glinting in the light of Devi’s flashlight. Nellie did not know what it was yet, but still, she wanted it more than anything, she wanted it to be hers and hers alone. She reached for the sparkling object and tugged it free. A locket on a thin gold chain, warm in her hand. The only warm thing in the world.

“You’re shivering again Nel,” said West. 

“What is that?” Devi asked.

“It’s mine,” Nellie snapped, then she shook her head, smiling a weak apology at Devi. “It’s a locket. Just a trinket. Costume jewellery. Not worth anything… I’m going to keep it.”

“You okay, Nel?” West asked. “You look-”

“Leave me alone West!” 

Nellie clutched the locket close, considered, then lifted the chain over her head. The locket slipped down the inside of her turtleneck, sliding against her skin, so warm she could barely feel it. Like fingertips along her sternum. Compared to the warmth of the locket, the library had never felt colder. 

“Let’s get out of here,” said Nellie.

“You don’t want to explore anymore?” Devi asked.

“It’s freezing,” said Nellie, shaking her head. “I need… We need to go.”

“Stop being so suggestive,” West laughed.

Nellie guessed he could not see her rolling her eyes, but she rolled them anyway.

“Does it work?” Devi asked.

“Can a telescope stop working?” West asked.

She looked through the telescope and for a moment thought that she had forgotten to check for a lens cap, because all she saw was black. But when she checked, there was no cap. Maybe a telescope could stop working, somehow, but in her gut, she doubted it.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

&quot;Guys, we&#39;ve barely looked around this part of the house and you&#39;re already...&quot; Devi trailed off, taking deep breaths.

Nellie and West glanced at each other.

&quot;We always take stuff like this for the show,&quot; Nellie said.

&quot;I know,&quot; Devi snapped. &quot;You usually just do a bit more investigating first. There was a whole library downstairs and you came up here-&quot;

&quot;We can still explore the library,&quot; Nellie cut in.

&quot;Or... we could move on?&quot; West suggested. 

Devi didn&#39;t respond, so Nellie nodded for her. It felt wrong to answer for her, but Devi was already shuffling down the stairs. West shrugged his confusion, and they followed her further into the mansion.

&quot;Right...&quot; Nellie drawled.

&quot;No use crying over spilled ectoplasm,&quot; said West.

&quot;Gross,&quot; said Devi.

&quot;He&#39;s right though,&quot; said Nellie. &quot;Can&#39;t do anything about it except keep moving forward.&quot;

Nellie was shivering still, but she shook her head. 

“Continuity,” she said. “I’ll survive. We just need to… keep looking around. Film. Stuff.”

Nellie pretended not to see Devi and West share a concerned glance. They had too much to do, and she only had enough energy to try to keep walking with making her trembling too obvious. The locket was not warm enough to ease the chill of the house. She wished she had worn a thicker turtleneck. She didn’t care if it would ruin the audio. Her chattering teeth might do that anyway. She tried to ignore the cold that settled into her bones and focus on the room. 

Nellie was expecting something a little more sinister from a man who made the papers for claiming to have accessed uncharted netherworlds full of nightmares beyond our comprehension, but she supposed those pursuits were best left to the young. Or at least left in the past with flared jeans and sequin tops. When life came at you hard and fast, or the illusion of fast after decades of smoking cigars and ignoring the persistent cough that came with it, you didn’t have time for spirits and demons anymore. 

Maybe at one point there was a stately wooden bed or some hyper-modern monstrosity of a bed, but all that was left in the room was one of those hospital-style rolling gurneys. A fancy one, wider and with deeper cushions than anything Nellie saw at her grandmother’s nursing home, but if you didn’t know expensive hospital equipment you wouldn’t have been impressed. 

“Guidebook?” West asked.

“There’s nothing for this room,” Nellie said. “Bradford was alive when the tours were happening, but he would stay shut in his room. No one was allowed to see him or come here. Besides, this was his private space.”

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“I think there are some castle tours in Scotland like that,” said Devi.

“Haunted ones?” West asked, perking up. “We should do a trip. Claim it as a business expense.”

“Sure, West, I’ll bet the IRS will love that for us,” Nellie groaned.

There was another door on the far wall, as solid as the front door to the entry room, but this handle turned easily.

“We’ll go to the garden next,” Devi said and Nellie dropped the handle. “We have to cross it to get to the Gallery. And we might see the ghost of Bradford’s son, Mark. If Bradford killed him, amateur sleuths think that’s where he was probably buried. But no body was found so… probably not.”

“It could have been eaten by worms,” Nellie suggested.

“I don’t think worms work that fast,” West countered. “Unless they’re like, ‘Dune’ worms.”

Nellie left the door for later, stepped around a few sunken sections of carpet, and pretended to look thoughtfully at the framed pictures on the wall in case West was filming her. If she looked distressed, it would add to the haunted vibe, she supposed. 
West was filming a wardrobe in the corner, which may have been engraved in violent gouging designs or else it had been beset by gnawing rats at some point. Devi was standing by the hospital bed, looking particularly forlorn. 

“Anything interesting?” Nellie asked, but she couldn’t make her voice quite as enthusiastic as she hoped.

Nellie, Devi, and West looked up at the ceiling, the glass a continuation from the entry room ceiling, which Nellie thought didn’t make sense with the blueprint but she had been warned the mansion would be confusing. If she had read the guidebook more closely, perhaps she could have pictured it better in her head. And she wasn’t all that worried about picturing it. She was invested in her current view.

Maybe the clouds had passed, or maybe it was the occult magic of the Bennington mansion, but Nellie could have sworn that there were not so many stars in the sky when they drove up. That the moon wasn’t so full. It made her feel like crying. It made her feel small and unimportant.

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West.

Nellie could see the shadowed shapes of beds around her, elegant little boxy things with elegant little boxy side tables, but it was hard to care too much about what was in this room when she could look at what was above it. 

“Hey, Nellie, you’ve been standing there awhile,” Devi said, giving her should a gentle tap or tug.

Nellie made sure her smile didn’t fade for the camera as she pulled her gaze away from the stars to the few items still left in a room that had been mostly cleared out. 

“What does the guidebook say?” asked West.

Nellie squinted at the pages.

“I should have read this on the stairs,” said Nellie. “It’s definitely a bedroom. Wait, it’s definitely an observatory. Okay, it definitely belonged to the lovers who used it as… yep, a bedroom and an observatory, it was the observatory first, they took it for themselves to not sleep with Bradford after one of the kids died and the romance died too, and the observatory was good for occult stuff-”

“Stop saying ‘observatory,’” said West. “Let’s just look around or something. Enjoy the view for a bit.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West, already turning the camera away.

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said, reaching into the shadows behind the cube. 
She never would have seen it without the bright moonlight, but there it was, begging her to take it. She lifted up the book, in much better condition than the ones in the library, though the paper was soft against her hands. It wasn’t hardbound. It wasn’t bound at all. It looked like the kind of spiral journal she used to bring to school. 

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary, too quickly for her to catch or get a good look at. West knelt on the ground, but the floor was in rougher shape than they realized, full of cracks and holes. Whatever fell out of the book could have fallen into any of them. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

She saw Devi almost protest as Nellie slipped the book into her bag, then change her mind, letting Nellie lead them down the stairs.

For a moment she thought it was because it was a little broken, that its odd angle was the result of damage from time or vandals or other ghostly investigators who weren’t exactly respectful. Then she suddenly remembered something, a scene in some mobster movie that always struck her as needlessly fancy.

“Nellie, don’t break the globe,” Devi warned.

“She’s not,” said West.

Nellie popped the top off the globe on its hinge, revealing a collection of glass bottles inside half-filled with suspicious brown liquid.

“Scotch?” West asked.

“I’m not tasting it to find out,” Nellie laughed. “But the crystal’s pretty.”

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

Nellie stared at the tapestry and felt the hairs rise on the back of her neck. It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns to give the viewers something to focus on. “Do any of the Benningtons have a ‘V’ name?”

“You’re the one with the guidebook,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“What is it, Nel?” West asked, hurrying over with the camera.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

“No sludge?” asked Devi, smirking. 

“No sludge,” Nellie agreed. 

She pulled out one of the books, with a picture of Nancy crouching behind a staircase still mostly visible on the cover. 

“Reading isn’t really captivating TV,” West said.

“Shh, it’s good for the soul,” Nellie grinned, but her smile dropped.

There was something on the shelf, tucked behind the books, glinting in the light of Devi’s flashlight. Nellie did not know what it was yet, but still, she wanted it more than anything, she wanted it to be hers and hers alone. She reached for the sparkling object and tugged it free. A locket on a thin gold chain, warm in her hand. The only warm thing in the world.

“You’re shivering again Nel,” said West. 

“What is that?” Devi asked.

“It’s mine,” Nellie snapped, then she shook her head, smiling a weak apology at Devi. “It’s a locket. Just a trinket. Costume jewellery. Not worth anything… I’m going to keep it.”

“You okay, Nel?” West asked. “You look-”

“Leave me alone West!” 

Nellie clutched the locket close, considered, then lifted the chain over her head. The locket slipped down the inside of her turtleneck, sliding against her skin, so warm she could barely feel it. Like fingertips along her sternum. Compared to the warmth of the locket, the library had never felt colder. 

“Let’s get out of here,” said Nellie.

“You don’t want to explore anymore?” Devi asked.

“It’s freezing,” said Nellie, shaking her head. “I need… We need to go.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West, already turning the camera away.

She never would have seen it without the bright moonlight, but there it was, begging her to take it.

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary, too quickly for her to catch or get a good look at. West knelt on the ground, but the floor was in rougher shape than they realized, full of cracks and holes. Whatever fell out of the book could have fallen into any of them. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

Nellie and West glanced at each other.

&quot;We always take stuff like this for the show,&quot; Nellie said.

&quot;I know,&quot; Devi snapped. &quot;You usually just do a bit more investigating first. First the ribbon, now this? There was a whole library downstairs and you came up here-&quot;

&quot;We can still explore the library,&quot; Nellie cut in.

&quot;Or... we could move on?&quot; West suggested. 

Devi didn&#39;t respond, so Nellie nodded for her. It felt wrong to answer for her, but Devi was already shuffling down the stairs. West shrugged his confusion, and they followed her further into the mansion.

[[Bradford&#39;s Bedroom - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Diary and Ribbon)]]

Nellie was shivering still, but she shook her head. 

“Continuity,” she said. “I’ll survive. We just need to… keep looking around. Film. Stuff.”

Nellie pretended not to see Devi and West share a concerned glance. They had too much to do, and she only had enough energy to try to keep walking with making her trembling too obvious. The locket was not warm enough to ease the chill of the house. She wished she had worn a thicker turtleneck. She didn’t care if it would ruin the audio. Her chattering teeth might do that anyway. She tried to ignore the cold that settled into her bones and focus on the room. 

Nellie was expecting something a little more sinister from a man who made the papers for claiming to have accessed uncharted netherworlds full of nightmares beyond our comprehension, but she supposed those pursuits were best left to the young. Or at least left in the past with flared jeans and sequin tops. When life came at you hard and fast, or the illusion of fast after decades of smoking cigars and ignoring the persistent cough that came with it, you didn’t have time for spirits and demons anymore. 

Maybe at one point there was a stately wooden bed or some hyper-modern monstrosity of a bed, but all that was left in the room was one of those hospital-style rolling gurneys. A fancy one, wider and with deeper cushions than anything Nellie saw at her grandmother’s nursing home, but if you didn’t know expensive hospital equipment you wouldn’t have been impressed. 

“Guidebook?” West asked.

“There’s nothing for this room,” Nellie said. “Bradford was alive when the tours were happening, but he would stay shut in his room. No one was allowed to see him or come here. Besides, this was his private space.”

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“I think there are some castle tours in Scotland like that,” said Devi.

“Haunted ones?” West asked, perking up. “We should do a trip. Claim it as a business expense.”

“Sure, West, I’ll bet the IRS will love that for us,” Nellie groaned.

There was another door on the far wall, as solid as the front door to the entry room, but this handle turned easily.

“We’ll go to the garden next,” Devi said and Nellie dropped the handle. “We have to cross it to get to the Gallery. And we might see the ghost of Bradford’s son, Mark. If Bradford killed him, amateur sleuths think that’s where he was probably buried. But no body was found so… probably not.”

“It could have been eaten by worms,” Nellie suggested.

“I don’t think worms work that fast,” West countered. “Unless they’re like, ‘Dune’ worms.”

Nellie left the door for later, stepped around a few sunken sections of carpet, and pretended to look thoughtfully at the framed pictures on the wall in case West was filming her. If she looked distressed, it would add to the haunted vibe, she supposed. 
West was filming a wardrobe in the corner, which may have been engraved in violent gouging designs or else it had been beset by gnawing rats at some point. Devi was standing by the hospital bed, looking particularly forlorn. 

“Anything interesting?” Nellie asked, but she couldn’t make her voice quite as enthusiastic as she hoped.

She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

Nellie stared at the tapestry and felt the hairs rise on the back of her neck. It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns to give the viewers something to focus on. “Do any of the Benningtons have a ‘V’ name?”

“You’re the one with the guidebook,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West.

Nellie, Devi, and West looked up at the ceiling, the glass a continuation from the entry room ceiling, which Nellie thought didn’t make sense with the blueprint but she had been warned the mansion would be confusing. If she had read the guidebook more closely, perhaps she could have pictured it better in her head. And she wasn’t all that worried about picturing it. She was invested in her current view.

Maybe the clouds had passed, or maybe it was the occult magic of the Bennington mansion, but Nellie could have sworn that there were not so many stars in the sky when they drove up. That the moon wasn’t so full. It made her feel like crying. It made her feel small and unimportant.

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West.

Nellie could see the shadowed shapes of beds around her, elegant little boxy things with elegant little boxy side tables, but it was hard to care too much about what was in this room when she could look at what was above it. 

“Hey, Nellie, you’ve been standing there awhile,” Devi said, giving her should a gentle tap or tug.

Nellie made sure her smile didn’t fade for the camera as she pulled her gaze away from the stars to the few items still left in a room that had been mostly cleared out. 

“What does the guidebook say?” asked West.

Nellie squinted at the pages.

“I should have read this on the stairs,” said Nellie. “It’s definitely a bedroom. Wait, it’s definitely an observatory. Okay, it definitely belonged to the lovers who used it as… yep, a bedroom and an observatory, it was the observatory first, they took it for themselves to not sleep with Bradford after one of the kids died and the romance died too, and the observatory was good for occult stuff-”

“Stop saying ‘observatory,’” said West. “Let’s just look around or something. Enjoy the view for a bit.”

“Stop being so suggestive,” West laughed.

Nellie guessed he could not see her rolling her eyes, but she rolled them anyway.

“Does it work?” Devi asked.

“Can a telescope stop working?” West asked.

“Let’s find out,” said Nellie.

She looked through the telescope and for a moment thought that she had forgotten to check for a lens cap, because all she saw was black. But when she checked, there was no cap. Maybe a telescope could stop working, somehow, but in her gut, she doubted it. She did not understand it, but when she looked through the telescope, all of those beautiful stars disappeared… if they were even there at all. 

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West, already turning the camera away.

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said, reaching into the shadows behind the cube. 
She never would have seen it without the bright moonlight, but there it was, begging her to take it. She lifted up the book, in much better condition than the ones in the library, though the paper was soft against her hands. It wasn’t hardbound. It wasn’t bound at all. It looked like the kind of spiral journal she used to bring to school. 

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary, too quickly for her to catch or get a good look at. West knelt on the ground, but the floor was in rougher shape than they realized, full of cracks and holes. Whatever fell out of the book could have fallen into any of them. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

She saw Devi almost protest as Nellie slipped the book into her bag, then change her mind, letting Nellie lead them down the stairs.

“That is… shockingly convenient,” said West, squelching across the wet carpet to her. 

“Maybe it’s a prop for ghost tours like us,” Nellie said. 

“It’s old, I think,” said Devi. “Some of the ink has bled, but it looks like a letter from Bradford to his daughter, Tara. He’s apologizing for… something. ‘You have responsibilities no one should have to bear, and I’m sorry I doomed you to this lonely existence.’ That’s sad, it’s not his fault he got sick.”

“Tell that to the doctors’ warnings on cigar boxes,” Nellie snorted.

“Here, Nellie, you keep reading,” said Devi, shoving the letter into her hands.

“Careful with that!” Nellie said. “West, film me. He apologizes to Tara, tells her she has responsibilities, and says… this is hard to make out, it’s so dark in here… He says Mark was a threat to the family, he did what he had to do…”

“Is he confessing to killing him?” asked West.

“He might just be confessing to kicking him out,” Nellie said, shaking her head. “There aren’t any specifics. Okay, then he says his daughter Dawn never understood, she was a danger… she was in danger? Well, there’s a paragraph about Dawn and danger and… Emma?”

“Emma was Dawn’s girlfriend,” Devi said, then shook her head. “Well, her tragically dead girlfriend.”

“The writing isn&#39;t clear there,” said Nellie. “But then he says he’s trapped, he just wants to be free, maybe it’s a final gift he can give Tara… ugh. Oh no.”

“What?” asked Devi.

“He’s asking her to sacrifice him. For her own freedom.”

The three crewmembers were silent for a moment, the only sound West’s boots shifting on the wet carpet.

“But we don’t know if she killed him,” said West.

“We don’t even know if this note is real,” said Nellie, placing the now more crumpled paper back on the hospital bed. “One of Devi’s amateur sleuths could have left it behind.”

“They’re not ‘my’ sleuths,” Devi mumbled.

“We are not going down into the scary secret passageway in the demonic occult building,” said Devi. “Besides, it’s too dark for us to really see what’s down there, anyway. My flashlight’s batteries are dead.”

“Well, what else are we going to show our viewers?” asked West, grinning at Devi, but his good cheer felt like more like a challenge than a joke.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="177" name="Hospital Bed - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Diary and Ribbon)" tags="" position="375,1050" size="100,100">“There’s a letter on this bed,” Devi said.

“That is… shockingly convenient,” said West, squelching across the wet carpet to her. 
“Maybe it’s a prop for ghost tours like us,” Nellie said. 

“It’s old, I think,” said Devi. “Some of the ink has bled, but it looks like a letter from Bradford to his daughter, Tara. He’s apologizing for… something. ‘You have responsibilities no one should have to bear, and I’m sorry I doomed you to this lonely existence.’ That’s sad, it’s not his fault he got sick.”

“Tell that to the doctors’ warnings on cigar boxes,” Nellie snorted.

“Here, Nellie, you keep reading,” said Devi, shoving the letter into her hands.

“Careful with that!” Nellie said. “West, film me. He apologizes to Tara, tells her she has responsibilities, and says… this is hard to make out, it’s so dark in here… He says Mark was a threat to the family, he did what he had to do…”

“Is he confessing to killing him?” asked West.

“He might just be confessing to kicking him out,” Nellie said, shaking her head. “There aren’t any specifics. Okay, then he says his daughter Dawn never understood, she was a danger… she was in danger? Well, there’s a paragraph about Dawn and danger and… Emma?”

“Emma was Dawn’s girlfriend,” Devi said, then shook her head. “Well, her tragically dead girlfriend.”

“The writing isn&#39;t clear there,” said Nellie. “But then he says he’s trapped, he just wants to be free, maybe it’s a final gift he can give Tara… ugh. Oh no.”

“What?” asked Devi.

“He’s asking her to sacrifice him. For her own freedom.”

The three crewmembers were silent for a moment, the only sound West’s boots shifting on the wet carpet.

“But we don’t know if she killed him,” said West.

“We don’t even know if this note is real,” said Nellie, placing the now more crumpled paper back on the hospital bed. “One of Devi’s amateur sleuths could have left it behind.”

“They’re not ‘my’ sleuths,” Devi mumbled.

“What is that?” Nellie gasped.

The wardrobe appeared to be a door, not a wardrobe, leading down into the ground, into darkness.

“It is a creepy secret passageway,” West declared. “What do you say, fearless leader? Should we go down?”

“We are not going down into the scary secret passageway in the demonic occult building,” said Devi. “Besides, it’s too dark for us to really see what’s down there, anyway. My flashlight’s batteries are dead.”

A high thick fence, at least ten feet high, kept them enclosed on the path to the garden and eventually the gallery, but the open sky above her felt like freedom. The darkness, the rot of the interior was impossibly oppressive. She took a gulp of air that tasted like salt and strawberries, sweetness sharpened to an edge. 

“I don’t know what I expected from a garden in the desert,” West chuckled as he filmed a slow circle around them.

The plants were all cacti, most of them taller than West who towered over his other crew members by a foot at least. The smallest ones came up to the diminutive Devi’s waste. Every cacti boasted blooming flowers, some just one impressive bloom at their “head,” others speckled in clusters like Nellie had never seen before. The blooms varied from a pale pink to a deep bloody red, so ripe that Nellie expected the petals to stain her fingers.

“Hold that position,” said West, getting a close up of her fingers gently caressing a petal.

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” said Devi.

“Oh shit,” said Nellie, hopping off the gravel to the dirt that surrounded it. “Did we mess up some kind of art piece? Shit!”

“No, I mean the layout of the path,” said Devi, gesturing down.

Her pointing finger guided Nellie’s eyes along the swirl that brought them to the center of the planted cacti before leading them out and onward to the hexagon-shaped building in front of them. If the walls weren’t so smooth, that gentle beige-pink that matched the rest of the mansion’s exterior, she would have guessed it was a gazebo that had been boarded up. The windows, covered by nailed planks of wood, gave that impression.  

“It’s like a mandala, I think,” said West, filming the path. “Not really occult, but kind of mystic I guess.”

Devi shrugged, maybe in agreement, but she was distracted by her headphones.

“Anything good?” Nellie asked her.

Devi was turning slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room.

“Actually, there might be,” she said. “Coming from the gallery. It’s like… well, we could just be getting an errant radio signal, but I think I hear music. I think it’s coming through the mic, it’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

Nellie was about to reach for Devi’s headphones, but West swatted her hand and they stood in silence for almost a minute, barely breathing.

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said. “Nellie, maybe you could read the guidebook entry from here? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

“Let me enlighten you,” Nellie said, relieved to have an excuse to stay outside a little longer. “The Gallery was renowned for housing some of the most expensive commissioned art pieces of the mid-twentieth century, some completed by world-renowned masters and others by either anonymous or unknown creatives. While some have attempted to make reproductions based on the photographs of the works, the originals have never left the property, despite numerous bids from museums and private collectors alike. Though art critics often disparaged Bradford’s taste on principle due to his children’s inclinations towards Rock n Roll, considered distinctly unclassy at the time, his manner of hoarding the pieces and their uniqueness has leant the collection considerable value. Even during the height of his life, before the deaths of any of his children, no one except a member of the Bennington family was allowed to visit the gallery. His wishes for the space to remain a sacred family space have been respected to this day.”

“That is an outdated guidebook,” West laughed.

“Nellie, I think that’s the first time you actually read the entry in its entirety,” Devi said, both teasing and pleased.

“I wanted to end the show with a professional bang,” Nellie shrugged.

She wanted to keep them outside for as long as possible. But her crew was waiting, so she made herself a fearless leader and opened the door to the Gallery.

The darkness felt like it was grabbing at her as they went inside.

“Keep the door open,” she instructed West who nodded, letting the starlight illuminate the spacious room, and cast deep shadows the stretched from the larger art pieces like clawing fingers.

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped completely when we came inside,” she said.

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends, perhaps, who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. There was no response.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West.

“Good idea,” said Nellie. “Let’s poke around.”

“I completely understand, and you have my full permission,” said West. “Devi, if it’s too scary for you-”

“I’m coming,” Devi grumbled. “Someone has to record your screams for posterity.”

Nellie led the way down the stairs. The red light from the camera, and the assorted lights from Devi’s recorder offered barely enough light for them to not trip over their feet on the way down. At least these stairs were broad, and free of that sludge. Nellie kept one hand against the curving wall beside her, surprised at how much warmer it was than her skin. She thought about asking the others if it felt the same to them, but changed her mind.

“Are you saying that if monsters strike you won’t be screaming?” Nellie asked, pleased that her voice sounded even despite her growing trepidation.

“When it comes to ‘fight’ or ‘flight,’ I’m a straight up ‘freeze,’” Devi said.

They walked down for a while without speaking. The only sounds for Devi to record were their heavy breaths and shoes scraping against dusty stone. 

“Is it getting lighter?” asked West.

He was right. Nellie could just see the steps in front of her, enough to notice when they reached solid ground. Solid underground. It almost looked like faint starlight, the same light that illuminated the rest of the house, but it was coming from an object in the middle of the room.

“Is that… it looks like an altar,” said Devi, her voice quavering slightly.

Nellie walked towards it, though she could feel Devi’s distress at her choice. It did not look like it was glowing, not like a light bulb or some kind of fluorescent novelty item, which wouldn’t have been so strange for an occult 1970s millionaire to have. The light was gentle, if fog could be light that was how it felt to Nellie. It was kind of nice. Warm, like the wall. Soothing. She set a hand on the flat, round surface, and it was perfectly smooth, not dusty like the stairs, except for a deep engraving that ran in two elegant lines.

“A ‘V,’” murmured Devi.

“Horns,” said West.

Nellie didn’t care. It was warmer than the fog, the walls. It was wrong. It knew they were there.

“We should leave the house,” said Nellie before she could think about what she was saying.

“We don’t have enough footage yet for the show,” West protested. “This is cool, but it’s not like we can just be done because we found something good.”

“The owner doesn’t usually let investigators see the gallery, everything’s super fragile in there,” Devi said. “We can’t lose this opportunity. Unless… unless you’re really not feeling well or something like that?”

Nellie shrugged off Devi’s comforting hand on her shoulder.

“You’re right,” Nellie said. “Both of you. I’m fine. I’ll be fine. Let’s just get to the gallery… Did you get that West?”

“Damn it, Nellie, was that a performance?”

Nellie grinned, and hoped it was convincing. 

“Back up to reality we go,” she said, letting her smile fade as the crew filed in behind her, careful now not to touch the wall, no matter how nice she knew it would feel.

“Maybe it’s a prop for ghost tours like us,” Nellie said. 

“It’s old, I think,” said Devi. “Some of the ink has bled, but it looks like a letter from Bradford to his daughter, Tara. He’s apologizing for… something. ‘You have responsibilities no one should have to bear, and I’m sorry I doomed you to this lonely existence.’ That’s sad, it’s not his fault he got sick.”

“Tell that to the doctors’ warnings on cigar boxes,” Nellie snorted.

“Here, Nellie, you keep reading,” said Devi, shoving the letter into her hands.

“Careful with that!” Nellie said. “West, film me. He apologizes to Tara, tells her she has responsibilities, and says… this is hard to make out, it’s so dark in here… He says Mark was a threat to the family, he did what he had to do…”

“Is he confessing to killing him?” asked West.

“He might just be confessing to kicking him out,” Nellie said, shaking her head. “There aren’t any specifics. Okay, then he says his daughter Dawn never understood, she was a danger… she was in danger? Well, there’s a paragraph about Dawn and danger and… Emma?”

“Emma was Dawn’s girlfriend,” Devi said, then shook her head. “Well, her tragically dead girlfriend.”

“The writing isn&#39;t clear there,” said Nellie. “But then he says he’s trapped, he just wants to be free, maybe it’s a final gift he can give Tara… ugh. Oh no.”

“What?” asked Devi.

“He’s asking her to sacrifice him. For her own freedom.”

The three crewmembers were silent for a moment, the only sound West’s boots shifting on the wet carpet.

“But we don’t know if she killed him,” said West.

“We don’t even know if this note is real,” said Nellie, placing the now more crumpled paper back on the hospital bed. “One of Devi’s amateur sleuths could have left it behind.”

“They’re not ‘my’ sleuths,” Devi mumbled.

“What is that?” Nellie gasped.

The wardrobe appeared to be a door, not a wardrobe, leading down into the ground, into darkness.

“It is a creepy secret passageway,” West declared. “What do you say, fearless leader? Should we go down?”

“We are not going down into the scary secret passageway in the demonic occult building,” said Devi. “Besides, it’s too dark for us to really see what’s down there, anyway. My flashlight’s batteries are dead.”

“Well, what else are we going to show our viewers?” asked West, grinning at Devi, but his good cheer felt like more like a challenge than a joke. 

[[Hospital Bed - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Locket)]]

[[Basement - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Locket)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="187" name="Gallery - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Locket)" tags="" position="375,1300" size="100,100">Nellie stepped into the hot, dry desert air of the garden and immediately felt a weight lift from her shoulders. A high thick fence, at least ten feet high, kept them enclosed on the path to the garden and eventually the gallery, but the open sky above her felt like freedom. The darkness, the rot of the interior was impossibly oppressive. She took a gulp of air that tasted like salt and strawberries, sweetness sharpened to an edge. 

“I don’t know what I expected from a garden in the desert,” West chuckled as he filmed a slow circle around them.

The plants were all cacti, most of them taller than West who towered over his other crew members by a foot at least. The smallest ones came up to the diminutive Devi’s waste. Every cacti boasted blooming flowers, some just one impressive bloom at their “head,” others speckled in clusters like Nellie had never seen before. The blooms varied from a pale pink to a deep bloody red, so ripe that Nellie expected the petals to stain her fingers.

“Hold that position,” said West, getting a close up of her fingers gently caressing a petal.

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” said Devi.

“Oh shit,” said Nellie, hopping off the gravel to the dirt that surrounded it. “Did we mess up some kind of art piece? Shit!”

“No, I mean the layout of the path,” said Devi, gesturing down.

Her pointing finger guided Nellie’s eyes along the swirl that brought them to the center of the planted cacti before leading them out and onward to the hexagon-shaped building in front of them. If the walls weren’t so smooth, that gentle beige-pink that matched the rest of the mansion’s exterior, she would have guessed it was a gazebo that had been boarded up. The windows, covered by nailed planks of wood, gave that impression.  

“It’s like a mandala, I think,” said West, filming the path. “Not really occult, but kind of mystic I guess.”

Devi shrugged, maybe in agreement, but she was distracted by her headphones.

“Anything good?” Nellie asked her.

Devi was turning slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room.

“Actually, there might be,” she said. “Coming from the gallery. It’s like… well, we could just be getting an errant radio signal, but I think I hear music. I think it’s coming through the mic, it’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

Nellie was about to reach for Devi’s headphones, but West swatted her hand and they stood in silence for almost a minute, barely breathing.

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said. “Nellie, maybe you could read the guidebook entry from here? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

“Let me enlighten you,” Nellie said, relieved to have an excuse to stay outside a little longer. “The Gallery was renowned for housing some of the most expensive commissioned art pieces of the mid-twentieth century, some completed by world-renowned masters and others by either anonymous or unknown creatives. While some have attempted to make reproductions based on the photographs of the works, the originals have never left the property, despite numerous bids from museums and private collectors alike. Though art critics often disparaged Bradford’s taste on principle due to his children’s inclinations towards Rock n Roll, considered distinctly unclassy at the time, his manner of hoarding the pieces and their uniqueness has leant the collection considerable value. Even during the height of his life, before the deaths of any of his children, no one except a member of the Bennington family was allowed to visit the gallery. His wishes for the space to remain a sacred family space have been respected to this day.”

“That is an outdated guidebook,” West laughed.

“Nellie, I think that’s the first time you actually read the entry in its entirety,” Devi said, both teasing and pleased.

“I wanted to end the show with a professional bang,” Nellie shrugged.

She wanted to keep them outside for as long as possible. But her crew was waiting, so she made herself a fearless leader and opened the door to the Gallery.

The darkness felt like it was grabbing at her as they went inside.

“Keep the door open,” she instructed West who nodded, letting the starlight illuminate the spacious room, and cast deep shadows the stretched from the larger art pieces like clawing fingers.

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped completely when we came inside,” she said.

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends, perhaps, who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. There was no response.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West.

“Good idea,” said Nellie. “Let’s poke around.”

“I completely understand, and you have my full permission,” said West. “Devi, if it’s too scary for you-”

“I’m coming,” Devi grumbled. “Someone has to record your screams for posterity.”

Nellie led the way down the stairs. The red light from the camera, and the assorted lights from Devi’s recorder offered barely enough light for them to not trip over their feet on the way down. At least these stairs were broad, and free of that sludge. Nellie kept one hand against the curving wall beside her, surprised at how much warmer it was than her skin. She thought about asking the others if it felt the same to them, but changed her mind.

“Are you saying that if monsters strike you won’t be screaming?” Nellie asked, pleased that her voice sounded even despite her growing trepidation.

“When it comes to ‘fight’ or ‘flight,’ I’m a straight up ‘freeze,’” Devi said.

They walked down for a while without speaking. The only sounds for Devi to record were their heavy breaths and shoes scraping against dusty stone. 

“Is it getting lighter?” asked West.

He was right. Nellie could just see the steps in front of her, enough to notice when they reached solid ground. Solid underground. It almost looked like faint starlight, the same light that illuminated the rest of the house, but it was coming from an object in the middle of the room.

“Is that… it looks like an altar,” said Devi, her voice quavering slightly.

Nellie walked towards it, though she could feel Devi’s distress at her choice. It did not look like it was glowing, not like a light bulb or some kind of fluorescent novelty item, which wouldn’t have been so strange for an occult 1970s millionaire to have. The light was gentle, if fog could be light that was how it felt to Nellie. It was kind of nice. Warm, like the wall. Soothing. She set a hand on the flat, round surface, and it was perfectly smooth, not dusty like the stairs, except for a deep engraving that ran in two elegant lines.

“A ‘V,’” murmured Devi.

“Horns,” said West.

Nellie didn’t care. It was warmer than the fog, the walls. It was wrong. It knew they were there.

“We should leave the house,” said Nellie before she could think about what she was saying.

“We don’t have enough footage yet for the show,” West protested. “This is cool, but it’s not like we can just be done because we found something good.”

“The owner doesn’t usually let investigators see the gallery, everything’s super fragile in there,” Devi said. “We can’t lose this opportunity. Unless… unless you’re really not feeling well or something like that?”

Nellie shrugged off Devi’s comforting hand on her shoulder.

“You’re right,” Nellie said. “Both of you. I’m fine. I’ll be fine. Let’s just get to the gallery… Did you get that West?”

“Damn it, Nellie, was that a performance?”

Nellie grinned, and hoped it was convincing. 

“Back up to reality we go,” she said, letting her smile fade as the crew filed in behind her, careful now not to touch the wall, no matter how nice she knew it would feel.

The wardrobe appeared to be a door, not a wardrobe, leading down into the ground, into darkness.

“It is a creepy secret passageway,” West declared. “What do you say, fearless leader? Should we go down?”

“We are not going down into the scary secret passageway in the demonic occult building,” said Devi. “Besides, it’s too dark for us to really see what’s down there, anyway. My flashlight’s batteries are dead.”

“Well, what else are we going to show our viewers?” asked West, grinning at Devi, but his good cheer felt like more like a challenge than a joke.

[[Basement - Nellie&#39;s Tour (GR with Locket)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="196" name="Gallery - Nellie&#39;s Tour (GR with Locket)" tags="" position="375,1300" size="100,100">Nellie stepped into the hot, dry desert air of the garden and immediately felt a weight lift from her shoulders. A high thick fence, at least ten feet high, kept them enclosed on the path to the garden and eventually the gallery, but the open sky above her felt like freedom. The darkness, the rot of the interior was impossibly oppressive. She took a gulp of air that tasted like salt and strawberries, sweetness sharpened to an edge. 

“I don’t know what I expected from a garden in the desert,” West chuckled as he filmed a slow circle around them.

The plants were all cacti, most of them taller than West who towered over his other crew members by a foot at least. The smallest ones came up to the diminutive Devi’s waste. Every cacti boasted blooming flowers, some just one impressive bloom at their “head,” others speckled in clusters like Nellie had never seen before. The blooms varied from a pale pink to a deep bloody red, so ripe that Nellie expected the petals to stain her fingers.

“Hold that position,” said West, getting a close up of her fingers gently caressing a petal.

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” said Devi.

“Oh shit,” said Nellie, hopping off the gravel to the dirt that surrounded it. “Did we mess up some kind of art piece? Shit!”

“No, I mean the layout of the path,” said Devi, gesturing down.

Her pointing finger guided Nellie’s eyes along the swirl that brought them to the center of the planted cacti before leading them out and onward to the hexagon-shaped building in front of them. If the walls weren’t so smooth, that gentle beige-pink that matched the rest of the mansion’s exterior, she would have guessed it was a gazebo that had been boarded up. The windows, covered by nailed planks of wood, gave that impression.  

“It’s like a mandala, I think,” said West, filming the path. “Not really occult, but kind of mystic I guess.”

Devi shrugged, maybe in agreement, but she was distracted by her headphones.

“Anything good?” Nellie asked her.

Devi was turning slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room.

“Actually, there might be,” she said. “Coming from the gallery. It’s like… well, we could just be getting an errant radio signal, but I think I hear music. I think it’s coming through the mic, it’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

Nellie was about to reach for Devi’s headphones, but West swatted her hand and they stood in silence for almost a minute, barely breathing.

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said. “Nellie, maybe you could read the guidebook entry from here? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

“Let me enlighten you,” Nellie said, relieved to have an excuse to stay outside a little longer. “The Gallery was renowned for housing some of the most expensive commissioned art pieces of the mid-twentieth century, some completed by world-renowned masters and others by either anonymous or unknown creatives. While some have attempted to make reproductions based on the photographs of the works, the originals have never left the property, despite numerous bids from museums and private collectors alike. Though art critics often disparaged Bradford’s taste on principle due to his children’s inclinations towards Rock n Roll, considered distinctly unclassy at the time, his manner of hoarding the pieces and their uniqueness has leant the collection considerable value. Even during the height of his life, before the deaths of any of his children, no one except a member of the Bennington family was allowed to visit the gallery. His wishes for the space to remain a sacred family space have been respected to this day.”

“That is an outdated guidebook,” West laughed.

“Nellie, I think that’s the first time you actually read the entry in its entirety,” Devi said, both teasing and pleased.

“I wanted to end the show with a professional bang,” Nellie shrugged.

She wanted to keep them outside for as long as possible. But her crew was waiting, so she made herself a fearless leader and opened the door to the Gallery.

The darkness felt like it was grabbing at her as they went inside.

“Keep the door open,” she instructed West who nodded, letting the starlight illuminate the spacious room, and cast deep shadows the stretched from the larger art pieces like clawing fingers.

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped completely when we came inside,” she said.

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends, perhaps, who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. There was no response.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West.

“Good idea,” said Nellie. “Let’s poke around.”

“I completely understand, and you have my full permission,” said West. “Devi, if it’s too scary for you-”

“I’m coming,” Devi grumbled. “Someone has to record your screams for posterity.”

Nellie led the way down the stairs. The red light from the camera, and the assorted lights from Devi’s recorder offered barely enough light for them to not trip over their feet on the way down. At least these stairs were broad, and free of that sludge. Nellie kept one hand against the curving wall beside her, surprised at how much warmer it was than her skin. She thought about asking the others if it felt the same to them, but changed her mind.

“Are you saying that if monsters strike you won’t be screaming?” Nellie asked, pleased that her voice sounded even despite her growing trepidation.

“When it comes to ‘fight’ or ‘flight,’ I’m a straight up ‘freeze,’” Devi said.

They walked down for a while without speaking. The only sounds for Devi to record were their heavy breaths and shoes scraping against dusty stone. 

“Is it getting lighter?” asked West.

He was right. Nellie could just see the steps in front of her, enough to notice when they reached solid ground. Solid underground. It almost looked like faint starlight, the same light that illuminated the rest of the house, but it was coming from an object in the middle of the room.

“Is that… it looks like an altar,” said Devi, her voice quavering slightly.

Nellie walked towards it, though she could feel Devi’s distress at her choice. It did not look like it was glowing, not like a light bulb or some kind of fluorescent novelty item, which wouldn’t have been so strange for an occult 1970s millionaire to have. The light was gentle, if fog could be light that was how it felt to Nellie. It was kind of nice. Warm, like the wall. Soothing. She set a hand on the flat, round surface, and it was perfectly smooth, not dusty like the stairs, except for a deep engraving that ran in two elegant lines.

“A ‘V,’” murmured Devi.

“Horns,” said West.

Nellie didn’t care. It was warmer than the fog, the walls. It was wrong. It knew they were there.

“We should leave the house,” said Nellie before she could think about what she was saying.

“We don’t have enough footage yet for the show,” West protested. “This is cool, but it’s not like we can just be done because we found something good.”

“The owner doesn’t usually let investigators see the gallery, everything’s super fragile in there,” Devi said. “We can’t lose this opportunity. Unless… unless you’re really not feeling well or something like that?”

Nellie shrugged off Devi’s comforting hand on her shoulder.

“You’re right,” Nellie said. “Both of you. I’m fine. I’ll be fine. Let’s just get to the gallery… Did you get that West?”

“Damn it, Nellie, was that a performance?”

Nellie grinned, and hoped it was convincing. 

“Back up to reality we go,” she said, letting her smile fade as the crew filed in behind her, careful now not to touch the wall, no matter how nice she knew it would feel.

“That is… shockingly convenient,” said West, squelching across the wet carpet to her. 

“Maybe it’s a prop for ghost tours like us,” Nellie said. 

“It’s old, I think,” said Devi. “Some of the ink has bled, but it looks like a letter from Bradford to his daughter, Tara. He’s apologizing for… something. ‘You have responsibilities no one should have to bear, and I’m sorry I doomed you to this lonely existence.’ That’s sad, it’s not his fault he got sick.”

“Tell that to the doctors’ warnings on cigar boxes,” Nellie snorted.

“Here, Nellie, you keep reading,” said Devi, shoving the letter into her hands.

“Careful with that!” Nellie said. “West, film me. He apologizes to Tara, tells her she has responsibilities, and says… this is hard to make out, it’s so dark in here… He says Mark was a threat to the family, he did what he had to do…”

“Is he confessing to killing him?” asked West.

“He might just be confessing to kicking him out,” Nellie said, shaking her head. “There aren’t any specifics. Okay, then he says his daughter Dawn never understood, she was a danger… she was in danger? Well, there’s a paragraph about Dawn and danger and… Emma?”

“Emma was Dawn’s girlfriend,” Devi said, then shook her head. “Well, her tragically dead girlfriend.”

“The writing isn&#39;t clear there,” said Nellie. “But then he says he’s trapped, he just wants to be free, maybe it’s a final gift he can give Tara… ugh. Oh no.”

“What?” asked Devi.

“He’s asking her to sacrifice him. For her own freedom.”

The three crewmembers were silent for a moment, the only sound West’s boots shifting on the wet carpet.

“But we don’t know if she killed him,” said West.

“We don’t even know if this note is real,” said Nellie, placing the now more crumpled paper back on the hospital bed. “One of Devi’s amateur sleuths could have left it behind.”

“They’re not ‘my’ sleuths,” Devi mumbled.

It was such a strong compulsion she would have been suspicious that it was an otherworldly pull if she didn’t feel this way every time she was in an art gallery. The texture always called to her. Her mom had to keep her on one of those leashes when she was in elementary school after an embarrassing incident at the Met. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo of at least four buns on her head, but Nellie had an oddly difficult time counting them. Each statue was poised on the tips of its toes and in a state of almost turning, either towards the woman next to her or away from the group entirely. Nellie was unsure if the dance was leading them to embrace each other or flee the room. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Wherever she was running to, she would not be hindered by the long fabric. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents that indicated freckles or some kind of tattoo, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“This should be in a museum, no offense to Bradford and his privacy,” Nellie said. 

[[Gallery 1 - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Diary from The Triad)]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="203" name="The Fountain of Life - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Diary)" tags="" position="375,1300" size="100,100">Nellie, West, and Devi climbed onto the large stone bench that surrounded the fountain at the center of the room in a perfect connected circle. They stared into the dip of the giant bowl.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

“Oh god,” Devi moaned.

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” she said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

[[Gallery 1 - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Diary from The Fountain of Life)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="204" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Diary)" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Nellie stepped up to the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe, the same woman she had seen in the photo in the hallway. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Nellie knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders that must have taken hours to style. Dawn lounged, uncomfortably, in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Nellie could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. It gave the oddest impression, like he was playing at nonchalance, waiting for the perfect moment to run away, off-frame. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and while Nellie thought his neatly cut afro was impressive she suspected it might have been of a rather modest size for the time. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt, a stance that reminded Nellie of old portraits of Napoleon, and though he seemed to be aiming for a neutral expression, he could not quite hold back the hint of a smirk. Either he thought this posturing was a joke, or he thought whoever would bother to view this painting in the future was a joke. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The curls looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The girl perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, making her pensive expression appear uneasy. The reddish undertones of her brown skin were highlighted by the pink of the dress, or else the artist had captured her while blushing. If she was blushing, Nellie wondered if it was just because she did not like the attention of being painted, or if it had something to do with whatever was drawing her gaze. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

Nellie did not blame her. The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder in a way that made Nellie’s stomach turn. But besides that, it was impossible to determine the specifics of his features.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Nellie did not want to leave Tara alone with her family, with that hand gripping her shoulder. 

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

Nellie barely heard them. That shadowed hand looked like a claw now. The urge to remove it from the girl’s shoulder was more compelling than the knowledge that she could do nothing for Tara, that whatever Tara had gone through was already done. She reached out and her fingers pressed against the faded paint.

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands to their ears, Devi giving a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her head to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Nellie thought one of them was laughing as they struggled to stand upright, but it could have been no one, or just noise, or even Nellie herself getting hysterical as she tried to keep her balance without removing her hands from her ears. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, but she could barely hear it or worry about what it meant with that overwhelming sound shrieking at her. Though she was trying not to listen, Nellie picked up noises from the chaos that sounded familiar, snatches of familiar melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Nellie to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence. 

[[Hotel California]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="205" name="A Constellation - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Diary)" tags="" position="375,1300" size="100,100">Six blocks of different sizes were scattered around the room.

“They’re all part of the same art installation, A Constellation,” Devi said.

The blocks were all grayish beige, or beigeish gray. Probably white at some point, but faded with time.

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi said, but she couldn’t hide a smile.

“At least this block’s big,” Nellie said. “Took some expense to make it. I appreciate the effort.”

It was such a strong compulsion she would have been suspicious that it was an otherworldly pull if she didn’t feel this way every time she was in an art gallery. The texture always called to her. Her mom had to keep her on one of those leashes when she was in elementary school after an embarrassing incident at the Met. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo of at least four buns on her head, but Nellie had an oddly difficult time counting them. Each statue was poised on the tips of its toes and in a state of almost turning, either towards the woman next to her or away from the group entirely. Nellie was unsure if the dance was leading them to embrace each other or flee the room. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Wherever she was running to, she would not be hindered by the long fabric. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents that indicated freckles or some kind of tattoo, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“This should be in a museum, no offense to Bradford and his privacy,” Nellie said.

They stared into the dip of the giant bowl.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

“Oh god,” Devi moaned.

The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. And yet, two sad eyes still managed to hold Nellie’s rapt attention.

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe, the same woman she had seen in the photo in the hallway. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Nellie knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore, the same one that now burned hot on Nellie’s skin. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders that must have taken hours to style. Nellie self-consciously fussed with her bangs, the blunt cut nothing like Dawn’s, but Nellie suspected no amount of styling could make her own cut compare with this woman’s beauty. Dawn lounged, uncomfortably, in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Nellie could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. It gave the oddest impression, like he was playing at nonchalance, waiting for the perfect moment to run away, off-frame. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and while Nellie thought his neatly cut afro was impressive she suspected it might have been of a rather modest size for the time. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt, a stance that reminded Nellie of old portraits of Napoleon, and though he seemed to be aiming for a neutral expression, he could not quite hold back the hint of a smirk. Either he thought this posturing was a joke, or he thought whoever would bother to view this painting in the future was a joke. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The curls looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The same ribbon that Nellie had hidden away in her pocket. The girl perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, making her pensive expression appear uneasy. The reddish undertones of her brown skin were highlighted by the pink of the dress, or else the artist had captured her while blushing. If she was blushing, Nellie wondered if it was just because she did not like the attention of being painted, or if it had something to do with whatever was drawing her gaze. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

Nellie did not blame her. The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But besides that, it was impossible to determine the specifics of his features.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Nellie did not want to leave Dawn alone with her family. With her sad eyes, and beautiful hair, and expression so full of a lovely despair that Devi and West could never hope to understand. 

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

Nellie barely heard them. Dawn’s honeyed skin called to her, looking so impossibly soft, she could not help but reach out and stroke the hand that sat weary in her lap. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands to their ears, Devi giving a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her head to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Nellie thought one of them was laughing as they struggled to stand upright, but it could have been no one, or just noise, or even Nellie herself getting hysterical as she tried to keep her balance without removing her hands from her ears. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, but she could barely hear it or worry about what it meant with that overwhelming sound shrieking at her. Though she was trying not to listen, Nellie picked up noises from the chaos that sounded familiar, snatches of familiar melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Nellie to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

It was such a strong compulsion she would have been suspicious that it was an otherworldly pull if she didn’t feel this way every time she was in an art gallery. The texture always called to her.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="249" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - Nellie&#39;s Tour (from Basement with Diary)" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Nellie stepped up to the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe, the same woman she had seen in the photo in the hallway. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Nellie knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders that must have taken hours to style. Dawn lounged, uncomfortably, in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Nellie could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. It gave the oddest impression, like he was playing at nonchalance, waiting for the perfect moment to run away, off-frame. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and while Nellie thought his neatly cut afro was impressive she suspected it might have been of a rather modest size for the time. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt, a stance that reminded Nellie of old portraits of Napoleon, and though he seemed to be aiming for a neutral expression, he could not quite hold back the hint of a smirk. Either he thought this posturing was a joke, or he thought whoever would bother to view this painting in the future was a joke. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The curls looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The girl perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, making her pensive expression appear uneasy. The reddish undertones of her brown skin were highlighted by the pink of the dress, or else the artist had captured her while blushing. If she was blushing, Nellie wondered if it was just because she did not like the attention of being painted, or if it had something to do with whatever was drawing her gaze. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

Nellie did not blame her. The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder in a way that made Nellie’s stomach turn. But besides that, it was impossible to determine the specifics of his features.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Nellie did not want to leave Tara alone with her family, with that hand gripping her shoulder. 

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

Nellie barely heard them. That shadowed hand looked like a claw now. The urge to remove it from the girl’s shoulder was more compelling than the knowledge that she could do nothing for Tara, that whatever Tara had gone through was already done. She reached out and her fingers pressed against the faded paint.

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands to their ears, Devi giving a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her head to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Nellie thought one of them was laughing as they struggled to stand upright, but it could have been no one, or just noise, or even Nellie herself getting hysterical as she tried to keep her balance without removing her hands from her ears. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, but she could barely hear it or worry about what it meant with that overwhelming sound shrieking at her. Though she was trying not to listen, Nellie picked up noises from the chaos that sounded familiar, snatches of familiar melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Nellie to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

Each statue was poised on the tips of its toes and in a state of almost turning, either towards the woman next to her or away from the group entirely. Nellie was unsure if the dance was leading them to embrace each other or flee the room. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Wherever she was running to, she would not be hindered by the long fabric. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents that indicated freckles or some kind of tattoo, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“This should be in a museum, no offense to Bradford and his privacy,” Nellie said.

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="271" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Diary and Ribbon)" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Nellie stepped up to the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe, the same woman she had seen in the photo in the hallway. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Nellie knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders that must have taken hours to style. Dawn lounged, uncomfortably, in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Nellie could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. It gave the oddest impression, like he was playing at nonchalance, waiting for the perfect moment to run away, off-frame. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and while Nellie thought his neatly cut afro was impressive she suspected it might have been of a rather modest size for the time. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt, a stance that reminded Nellie of old portraits of Napoleon, and though he seemed to be aiming for a neutral expression, he could not quite hold back the hint of a smirk. Either he thought this posturing was a joke, or he thought whoever would bother to view this painting in the future was a joke. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The curls looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The same ribbon that Nellie had hidden away in her pocket. The girl perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, making her pensive expression appear uneasy. The reddish undertones of her brown skin were highlighted by the pink of the dress, or else the artist had captured her while blushing. If she was blushing, Nellie wondered if it was just because she did not like the attention of being painted, or if it had something to do with whatever was drawing her gaze. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

Nellie did not blame her. The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder in a way that made Nellie’s stomach turn. But besides that, it was impossible to determine the specifics of his features.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Nellie did not want to leave Tara alone with her family, with that hand gripping her shoulder. 

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

Nellie barely heard them. That shadowed hand looked like a claw now. The urge to remove it from the girl’s shoulder was more compelling than the knowledge that she could do nothing for Tara, that whatever Tara had gone through was already done. She reached out and her fingers pressed against the faded paint.

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands to their ears, Devi giving a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her head to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Nellie thought one of them was laughing as they struggled to stand upright, but it could have been no one, or just noise, or even Nellie herself getting hysterical as she tried to keep her balance without removing her hands from her ears. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, but she could barely hear it or worry about what it meant with that overwhelming sound shrieking at her. Though she was trying not to listen, Nellie picked up noises from the chaos that sounded familiar, snatches of familiar melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Nellie to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

They stared into the dip of the giant bowl.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

“Oh god,” Devi moaned.

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” she said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

It was such a strong compulsion she would have been suspicious that it was an otherworldly pull if she didn’t feel this way every time she was in an art gallery. The texture always called to her. Her mom had to keep her on one of those leashes when she was in elementary school after an embarrassing incident at the Met. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo of at least four buns on her head, but Nellie had an oddly difficult time counting them. Each statue was poised on the tips of its toes and in a state of almost turning, either towards the woman next to her or away from the group entirely. Nellie was unsure if the dance was leading them to embrace each other or flee the room. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Wherever she was running to, she would not be hindered by the long fabric. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents that indicated freckles or some kind of tattoo, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars.

The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe, the same woman she had seen in the photo in the hallway. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Nellie knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders that must have taken hours to style. Dawn lounged, uncomfortably, in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Nellie could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. It gave the oddest impression, like he was playing at nonchalance, waiting for the perfect moment to run away, off-frame. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and while Nellie thought his neatly cut afro was impressive she suspected it might have been of a rather modest size for the time. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt, a stance that reminded Nellie of old portraits of Napoleon, and though he seemed to be aiming for a neutral expression, he could not quite hold back the hint of a smirk. Either he thought this posturing was a joke, or he thought whoever would bother to view this painting in the future was a joke. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The curls looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The same ribbon that Nellie had hidden away in her pocket. The girl perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, making her pensive expression appear uneasy. The reddish undertones of her brown skin were highlighted by the pink of the dress, or else the artist had captured her while blushing. If she was blushing, Nellie wondered if it was just because she did not like the attention of being painted, or if it had something to do with whatever was drawing her gaze. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

Nellie did not blame her. The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder in a way that made Nellie’s stomach turn. But besides that, it was impossible to determine the specifics of his features.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Nellie did not want to leave Tara alone with her family, with that hand gripping her shoulder. 

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

Nellie barely heard them. That shadowed hand looked like a claw now. The urge to remove it from the girl’s shoulder was more compelling than the knowledge that she could do nothing for Tara, that whatever Tara had gone through was already done. She reached out and her fingers pressed against the faded paint.

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands to their ears, Devi giving a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her head to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Nellie thought one of them was laughing as they struggled to stand upright, but it could have been no one, or just noise, or even Nellie herself getting hysterical as she tried to keep her balance without removing her hands from her ears. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, but she could barely hear it or worry about what it meant with that overwhelming sound shrieking at her. Though she was trying not to listen, Nellie picked up noises from the chaos that sounded familiar, snatches of familiar melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Nellie to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

They stared into the dip of the giant bowl.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

“Oh god,” Devi moaned.

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” she said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

“They’re all part of the same art installation, A Constellation,” Devi said.

The blocks were all grayish beige, or beigeish gray. Probably white at some point, but faded with time.

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi said, but she couldn’t hide a smile.

“At least this block’s big,” Nellie said. “Took some expense to make it. I appreciate the effort.”

It was such a strong compulsion she would have been suspicious that it was an otherworldly pull if she didn’t feel this way every time she was in an art gallery. The texture always called to her. Her mom had to keep her on one of those leashes when she was in elementary school after an embarrassing incident at the Met. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo of at least four buns on her head, but Nellie had an oddly difficult time counting them. Each statue was poised on the tips of its toes and in a state of almost turning, either towards the woman next to her or away from the group entirely. Nellie was unsure if the dance was leading them to embrace each other or flee the room. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Wherever she was running to, she would not be hindered by the long fabric. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents that indicated freckles or some kind of tattoo, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“This should be in a museum, no offense to Bradford and his privacy,” Nellie said.

[[Gallery 1 - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Locket from The Fountain of Life)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="315" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Locket)" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Nellie stepped up to the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. And yet, two sad eyes still managed to hold Nellie’s rapt attention.

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe, the same woman she had seen in the photo in the hallway. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Nellie knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore, the same one that now burned hot on Nellie’s skin. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders that must have taken hours to style. Nellie self-consciously fussed with her bangs, the blunt cut nothing like Dawn’s, but Nellie suspected no amount of styling could make her own cut compare with this woman’s beauty. Dawn lounged, uncomfortably, in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Nellie could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. It gave the oddest impression, like he was playing at nonchalance, waiting for the perfect moment to run away, off-frame. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and while Nellie thought his neatly cut afro was impressive she suspected it might have been of a rather modest size for the time. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt, a stance that reminded Nellie of old portraits of Napoleon, and though he seemed to be aiming for a neutral expression, he could not quite hold back the hint of a smirk. Either he thought this posturing was a joke, or he thought whoever would bother to view this painting in the future was a joke. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The curls looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The girl perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, making her pensive expression appear uneasy. The reddish undertones of her brown skin were highlighted by the pink of the dress, or else the artist had captured her while blushing. If she was blushing, Nellie wondered if it was just because she did not like the attention of being painted, or if it had something to do with whatever was drawing her gaze. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

Nellie did not blame her. The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But besides that, it was impossible to determine the specifics of his features.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Nellie did not want to leave Dawn alone with her family. With her sad eyes, and beautiful hair, and expression so full of a lovely despair that Devi and West could never hope to understand. 

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

Nellie barely heard them. Dawn’s honeyed skin called to her, looking so impossibly soft, she could not help but reach out and stroke the hand that sat weary in her lap. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands to their ears, Devi giving a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her head to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Nellie thought one of them was laughing as they struggled to stand upright, but it could have been no one, or just noise, or even Nellie herself getting hysterical as she tried to keep her balance without removing her hands from her ears. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, but she could barely hear it or worry about what it meant with that overwhelming sound shrieking at her. Though she was trying not to listen, Nellie picked up noises from the chaos that sounded familiar, snatches of familiar melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Nellie to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

They stared into the dip of the giant bowl.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

“Oh god,” Devi moaned.

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” she said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

“They’re all part of the same art installation, A Constellation,” Devi said.

The blocks were all grayish beige, or beigeish gray. Probably white at some point, but faded with time.

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

It was such a strong compulsion she would have been suspicious that it was an otherworldly pull if she didn’t feel this way every time she was in an art gallery. The texture always called to her. Her mom had to keep her on one of those leashes when she was in elementary school after an embarrassing incident at the Met. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo of at least four buns on her head, but Nellie had an oddly difficult time counting them. Each statue was poised on the tips of its toes and in a state of almost turning, either towards the woman next to her or away from the group entirely. Nellie was unsure if the dance was leading them to embrace each other or flee the room. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Wherever she was running to, she would not be hindered by the long fabric. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents that indicated freckles or some kind of tattoo, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“This should be in a museum, no offense to Bradford and his privacy,” Nellie said.

[[Gallery 1 - Nellie&#39;s Tour (from Basement with Locket from The Fountain of Life)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="337" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - Nellie&#39;s Tour (from Basement with Locket)" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Nellie stepped up to the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. And yet, two sad eyes still managed to hold Nellie’s rapt attention.

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe, the same woman she had seen in the photo in the hallway. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Nellie knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore, the same one that now burned hot on Nellie’s skin. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders that must have taken hours to style. Nellie self-consciously fussed with her bangs, the blunt cut nothing like Dawn’s, but Nellie suspected no amount of styling could make her own cut compare with this woman’s beauty. Dawn lounged, uncomfortably, in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Nellie could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. It gave the oddest impression, like he was playing at nonchalance, waiting for the perfect moment to run away, off-frame. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and while Nellie thought his neatly cut afro was impressive she suspected it might have been of a rather modest size for the time. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt, a stance that reminded Nellie of old portraits of Napoleon, and though he seemed to be aiming for a neutral expression, he could not quite hold back the hint of a smirk. Either he thought this posturing was a joke, or he thought whoever would bother to view this painting in the future was a joke. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The curls looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The girl perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, making her pensive expression appear uneasy. The reddish undertones of her brown skin were highlighted by the pink of the dress, or else the artist had captured her while blushing. If she was blushing, Nellie wondered if it was just because she did not like the attention of being painted, or if it had something to do with whatever was drawing her gaze. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

Nellie did not blame her. The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But besides that, it was impossible to determine the specifics of his features.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Nellie did not want to leave Dawn alone with her family. With her sad eyes, and beautiful hair, and expression so full of a lovely despair that Devi and West could never hope to understand. 

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

Nellie barely heard them. Dawn’s honeyed skin called to her, looking so impossibly soft, she could not help but reach out and stroke the hand that sat weary in her lap. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands to their ears, Devi giving a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her head to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Nellie thought one of them was laughing as they struggled to stand upright, but it could have been no one, or just noise, or even Nellie herself getting hysterical as she tried to keep her balance without removing her hands from her ears. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, but she could barely hear it or worry about what it meant with that overwhelming sound shrieking at her. Though she was trying not to listen, Nellie picked up noises from the chaos that sounded familiar, snatches of familiar melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Nellie to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

The blocks were all grayish beige, or beigeish gray. Probably white at some point, but faded with time.

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi said, but she couldn’t hide a smile.

“At least this block’s big,” Nellie said. “Took some expense to make it. I appreciate the effort.”

It was such a strong compulsion she would have been suspicious that it was an otherworldly pull if she didn’t feel this way every time she was in an art gallery. The texture always called to her. Her mom had to keep her on one of those leashes when she was in elementary school after an embarrassing incident at the Met. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo of at least four buns on her head, but Nellie had an oddly difficult time counting them. Each statue was poised on the tips of its toes and in a state of almost turning, either towards the woman next to her or away from the group entirely. Nellie was unsure if the dance was leading them to embrace each other or flee the room. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Wherever she was running to, she would not be hindered by the long fabric. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents that indicated freckles or some kind of tattoo, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“This should be in a museum, no offense to Bradford and his privacy,” Nellie said.

They stared into the dip of the giant bowl.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

“Oh god,” Devi moaned.

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” she said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

[[Gallery 1 - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Locket and Ribbon from The Fountain of Life)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="359" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - Nellie&#39;s Tour (with Locket and Ribbon)" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Nellie stepped up to the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. And yet, two sad eyes still managed to hold Nellie’s rapt attention.

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe, the same woman she had seen in the photo in the hallway. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Nellie knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore, the same one that now burned hot on Nellie’s skin. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders that must have taken hours to style. Nellie self-consciously fussed with her bangs, the blunt cut nothing like Dawn’s, but Nellie suspected no amount of styling could make her own cut compare with this woman’s beauty. Dawn lounged, uncomfortably, in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Nellie could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. It gave the oddest impression, like he was playing at nonchalance, waiting for the perfect moment to run away, off-frame. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and while Nellie thought his neatly cut afro was impressive she suspected it might have been of a rather modest size for the time. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt, a stance that reminded Nellie of old portraits of Napoleon, and though he seemed to be aiming for a neutral expression, he could not quite hold back the hint of a smirk. Either he thought this posturing was a joke, or he thought whoever would bother to view this painting in the future was a joke. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The curls looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The same ribbon that Nellie had hidden away in her pocket. The girl perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, making her pensive expression appear uneasy. The reddish undertones of her brown skin were highlighted by the pink of the dress, or else the artist had captured her while blushing. If she was blushing, Nellie wondered if it was just because she did not like the attention of being painted, or if it had something to do with whatever was drawing her gaze. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

Nellie did not blame her. The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But besides that, it was impossible to determine the specifics of his features.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Nellie did not want to leave Dawn alone with her family. With her sad eyes, and beautiful hair, and expression so full of a lovely despair that Devi and West could never hope to understand. 

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

Nellie barely heard them. Dawn’s honeyed skin called to her, looking so impossibly soft, she could not help but reach out and stroke the hand that sat weary in her lap. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands to their ears, Devi giving a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her head to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Nellie thought one of them was laughing as they struggled to stand upright, but it could have been no one, or just noise, or even Nellie herself getting hysterical as she tried to keep her balance without removing her hands from her ears. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, but she could barely hear it or worry about what it meant with that overwhelming sound shrieking at her. Though she was trying not to listen, Nellie picked up noises from the chaos that sounded familiar, snatches of familiar melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Nellie to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

“Oh god,” Devi moaned.

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” she said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

[[Gallery 1 - Nellie&#39;s Tour (GR with Locket from The Fountain of Life)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="381" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - Nellie&#39;s Tour (GR with Locket)" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Nellie stepped up to the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. And yet, two sad eyes still managed to hold Nellie’s rapt attention.

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe, the same woman she had seen in the photo in the hallway. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Nellie knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore, the same one that now burned hot on Nellie’s skin. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders that must have taken hours to style. Nellie self-consciously fussed with her bangs, the blunt cut nothing like Dawn’s, but Nellie suspected no amount of styling could make her own cut compare with this woman’s beauty. Dawn lounged, uncomfortably, in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Nellie could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. It gave the oddest impression, like he was playing at nonchalance, waiting for the perfect moment to run away, off-frame. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and while Nellie thought his neatly cut afro was impressive she suspected it might have been of a rather modest size for the time. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt, a stance that reminded Nellie of old portraits of Napoleon, and though he seemed to be aiming for a neutral expression, he could not quite hold back the hint of a smirk. Either he thought this posturing was a joke, or he thought whoever would bother to view this painting in the future was a joke. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The curls looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The girl perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, making her pensive expression appear uneasy. The reddish undertones of her brown skin were highlighted by the pink of the dress, or else the artist had captured her while blushing. If she was blushing, Nellie wondered if it was just because she did not like the attention of being painted, or if it had something to do with whatever was drawing her gaze. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

Nellie did not blame her. The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But besides that, it was impossible to determine the specifics of his features.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Nellie did not want to leave Dawn alone with her family. With her sad eyes, and beautiful hair, and expression so full of a lovely despair that Devi and West could never hope to understand. 

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

Nellie barely heard them. Dawn’s honeyed skin called to her, looking so impossibly soft, she could not help but reach out and stroke the hand that sat weary in her lap. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands to their ears, Devi giving a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her head to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Nellie thought one of them was laughing as they struggled to stand upright, but it could have been no one, or just noise, or even Nellie herself getting hysterical as she tried to keep her balance without removing her hands from her ears. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, but she could barely hear it or worry about what it meant with that overwhelming sound shrieking at her. Though she was trying not to listen, Nellie picked up noises from the chaos that sounded familiar, snatches of familiar melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Nellie to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

It was such a strong compulsion she would have been suspicious that it was an otherworldly pull if she didn’t feel this way every time she was in an art gallery. The texture always called to her. Her mom had to keep her on one of those leashes when she was in elementary school after an embarrassing incident at the Met. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo of at least four buns on her head, but Nellie had an oddly difficult time counting them. Each statue was poised on the tips of its toes and in a state of almost turning, either towards the woman next to her or away from the group entirely. Nellie was unsure if the dance was leading them to embrace each other or flee the room. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Wherever she was running to, she would not be hindered by the long fabric. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents that indicated freckles or some kind of tattoo, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“This should be in a museum, no offense to Bradford and his privacy,” Nellie said.

“They’re all part of the same art installation, A Constellation,” Devi said.

The blocks were all grayish beige, or beigeish gray. Probably white at some point, but faded with time.

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi said, but she couldn’t hide a smile.

“At least this block’s big,” Nellie said. “Took some expense to make it. I appreciate the effort.”

The stars that shone through the open door were brighter than she could have imagined. They must have made her eyes bluer, her skin glow like honey, she could feel it, as hot as the locket burning the skin on her chest. She deserved nice things, like the ribbon in her pocket, like… Emma. She deserved nice things, and the people who would take those things from her deserved to pay.

“We need to go!” Mark shouted, grabbing her arm.

Not Mark. West. Mark? Who was this man? Who were these people?

“Nellie, come on!” Emma insisted.

Not Emma. Devi. Emma was dead. Emma was dead because Mark couldn’t keep his mouth shut. Why did she have to lose everything, lose all the good things along with that terrible aching grief, because one man could not hold a secret in his heart. Men talking to men who thought they knew better than the little girls around them. They did not deserve nice things, like the lights in the sky or the breath in their lungs. 

A part of Nellie knew that these thoughts were not her own. She was not alone in her head. Dawn was here, Dawn was thinking for her, these were Dawn’s thought and desires influencing her, taking over. But when she tried to warn West and Devi, no words came out of her mouth. And then confusion overtook her. The two strangers, two memories, held her firmly, ran with her through the garden, the beautiful bleeding cacti that still grew tall and strong after so many years.

She had it wrong, all those years ago. He knew it, too. Not Mark, not Father, the other one. The man she had glimpsed once, in the basement, before deciding she would never be a part of that darkness, before realizing she had no choice if she wanted to keep Emma with her. If they could not be bound in life, if Mark would take Emma’s warmth and life and light out of her life, then she would bind them in the world that comes after. She would sacrifice anyone to make that happen, especially someone who deserved it. 

They passed bedrooms, dark and unfamiliar in their disorder, in their decay, a dizzying mix of memories old and new clamoring in her mind.

When she had a sense of the house, her spirit tucked away lonely with the books she once adored, she would sometimes think the man had not taken her soul because it could not be consumed incomplete, not without its other half. Now she was sure he had not taken in because she was the wrong sacrifice. She could do nothing about it, gathering dust, a curl of blond hair intermingled with a curl of black hair, together in the locket, but apart as ghosts for reasons she did not comprehend until this moment. She needed to right that past wrong. And with this body, she could.

They passed photos in the hall, from when she was happy, when she could perform the mask of happiness more convincingly. The hands were still on her, insisting, pulling her forward, but she dug her heels into the thick shag rug. 

“We have no idea what damage that quake did to the house,” Devi was saying.

“Don’t you hear it?” 

“Hear what?” asked West, West who was not who she wanted, but West who was here, and he would do.

“One last thing, it’s just what we need, it’s perfect.”

She pointed towards the door to the Séance Room. West was hesitant, but he walked to the door, pressing his ear against the wood. 

Neither crew member expected Nellie to lunge at him, pushing with all her strength, the strength of two women sharing one body. West’s body struck the door and the fragile frame snapped open, leading to the deep Pit below. The camera fell from his hands into a darkness so deep they did not hear a crash. And for a moment, West teetered on the edge of the longest fall. Devi reached past Nellie to catch him.

She could do nothing about it, gathering dust, a curl of blond hair intermingled with a curl of black hair, together in the locket, but apart as ghosts for reasons she did not comprehend until this moment. She needed to right that past wrong. And with this body, she could.

They passed photos in the hall, from when she was happy, when she could perform the mask of happiness more convincingly. The hands were still on her, insisting, pulling her forward, but she dug her heels into the thick shag rug. 

“We have no idea what damage that quake did to the house,” Devi was saying.

“Don’t you hear it?” 

“Hear what?” asked West, West who was not who she wanted, but West who was here, and he would do.

She pointed towards the door to the Séance Room. After a moment’s hesitation West turned to the door, but froze as Devi spoke.

“Oh my god,” she whispered. “I do hear it.”

Nellie frowned. There was nothing to hear. She just need to get West close to the Pit…

“It’s the music I heard in the Groove Room,” Devi continued, holding her headphones tight to her ears. “That song.”

“Devi, you can take the headphones off,” West said, voice soft, his wide eyes looking past his two crew members.

He was right. Even without Devi’s sensitive equipment, Nellie could hear it, too. A voice she thought she would never hear again, singing a song that she had written herself. She could have been a folk singer, as influential as Joni Mitchell, as beloved as Karen Carpenter. Dawn had loved her, and she had the money, her family had the connections. It should have all worked out. They should have been happy. Instead…

Emma let her song slip into an unsettling quiet before Nellie turned to face her. Those deep black almond eyes, that carefree cropped haircut. The smile that had never looked so sad when she was alive. She did not even looked at Devi as she passed through her, her form insubstantial, though Devi still let out a soft “oh” and stumbled back to the wall. Emma’s body felt solid to Nellie when she grabbed her hands, but she guessed it was not quite Nellie’s hands she was holding, but the ghost who was puppeteering her underneath that convenient skin. 

“Oh, Dawn,” Emma said, her voice mournful. “You have to let it go.”

Indignation burned through Nellie’s throat.

“No,” she hissed. “It’s not fair.”

“You’re right, it’s not,” Emma nodded, her eyes gliding towards West who cowered under the ghost’s attention. “But it was not Mark’s fault. And it is definitely not this boy’s fault. Killing him won’t make the pain go away.”

[[Kill West]]

[[Let it go]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="402" name="Night Moves" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Devi and West were saying something, but Nellie’s head ached. A voice whispered to her to let go of this body that had always felt like a gross cage, too much and not enough at the same time. The stars that shone through the open door were brighter than she could have imagined, too many, like she was seeing double. She shook her head and immediately regretted it, stumbling to the side, her weight wrong, her body ungainly. 

“We need to go!” Mark shouted, grabbing her arm.

Not Mark. West. Mark? Who was this man? Who were these people?

“Nellie, come on!” Emma insisted.

Not Emma. Devi. Emma was dead. Emma was dead because Mark couldn’t keep his mouth shut. Why did she have to lose everything, lose all the good things along with that terrible aching grief, because one man could not hold a secret in his heart. Men talking to men who thought they knew better than the little girls around them. 
“Something’s wrong…” Nellie began.

“Yeah, something’s wrong, that was an earthquake!” West shouted, grabbing her arm, steering her out of the gallery to the cacti with their bleeding petals. 

She had it wrong, all those years ago. He knew it, too. Not Mark, not Father, the other one. The man she had glimpsed once, in the basement, before deciding she would never be a part of that darkness, before realizing she had no choice if she wanted to keep Emma with her. If they could not be bound in life, if Mark would take Emma’s warmth and life and light out of her life, then she would bind them in the world that comes after. She would sacrifice anyone to make that happen, especially someone who deserved it. She had to get to the Séance Room door, to that fragile barrier to the Pit, and then throw him down below where he belongs -  

“No!” Nellie shouted, digging her heels into the gravel.

“Nellie, what’s wrong?” Devi asked, stopping beside her.

“We don’t have time for this!” West shouted. 

“There’s something in my head!”

That stopped West’s anxious pacing.

Nellie tried to take off her necklace and gasped at the pain. She pulled down the loose cowl of her turtleneck and Devi and West saw the locket glowing red-hot against her skin.

“What the hell?” West muttered.

//No, no!// a voice screamed in Nellie’s ears, and she closed her eyes against the pain. //He must pay!// 

“Stop it, I won’t do it!” Nellie screamed.

“Won’t do what?” Devi asked.

“She… she wants me to throw West into the Pit,” she said. “I think it’s Dawn. She’s in my head. Shit.”

“Um, wait,” Devi said, eyes widening. “Dawn is trying to possess you because she wants to kill West?”

“Why?” West asked, taking a step back from Nellie.

“She says he belongs down below,” Nellie said. 

“Again, why would she want that?” West demanded.

A soothing warmth ran up her skin. 

“It’s not just about what she wants,” Nellie said, the stars going blurry once more, and she was struck with a fear as cold as death. “The man below must be satisfied. Or he will never leave the three of us alone. He will never let us leave.”

“Yeah, big no to that,” West laughed, a tight pained sound. “If there is something in the Pit that wants to us, we should get as far away from the ground as possible. Preferable before it quakes again and, I don’t know, swallows me? Can it do that? Crap, we need to go!”

Nellie heard Dawn scream in her head.

//Don’t take us to the black stars, I don’t want to go, I don’t want to go!//

Dawn’s voice had grown quieter. Nellie could sense her straining to hear something. And she heard it, too. A gentle melody, beautiful and faint.

“Do you guys hear that?” Nellie asked.

“It’s the music I recorded earlier,” Devi said slowly. “It’s coming from the Groove Room.”

“So, we’re just dropping the whole ‘the ghost possessing Nellie wants to kill me’ thing?” West asked, almost sounding insulted. 

Nellie hushed him, reaching towards the Groove Room door.

“Nellie, wait a second,” said Devi. &quot;Maybe we should just go.&quot;

West’s hands reached for her, grasping and empty, before he lost his footing completely, falling into the darkness. 

It was right. It was what he deserved. It should have felt good.

“What did you do, Nellie?” 

Devi was crying, thrashing in the stronger girl’s grasp.

She did not feel good. She tried to listen, to hear screams from the Pit, or laughter telling her he was there and he was pleased, but she heard nothing. No music. No relief.
Nellie gasped, clutched at the locket that had grown red-hot, confused, angry, despairing. She let go of Devi who ran to the edge of the door, peering down into the Pit. Nellie grabbed the locket, screaming as it burned her hand, ripping it from her throat, tearing the chain. She tossed it onto the ground and Devi let out a soft “oh” as she turned to see the object glowing, sizzling in the heat it produced. It sounded like it was hissing. It sounded like it was crying.

Nellie was alone in her body once more. Her limbs felt heavy, her bones almost loose now that there was no one to puppet them. She stumbled, nearly fell to the carpet, but Devi was there beside her, wrapping Nellie’s arm over her shoulder. She took Nellie to the door that opened easily under her hand, offering them the gift of freedom, perhaps for a job well done.

“Thank you, Emma,” Nellie whispered as Devi maneuvered her into the passenger seat. Devi raised her eyebrow and Nellie winced. “I mean, Devi. Sorry. I… I don’t know why I did that. I don’t know what happened-”

“I can guess,” said Devi. “But I doubt the police will accept ‘Dawn did it.’”

Nellie’s eyes grew wet.

“What are we going to do?”

“Right now,” Devi said, hopping into the drivers’ seat and starting the car. “We’re getting as far away from the Bennington mansion, and the Bennington family, as possible.”

Nellie put her hand on Devi’s as she drove and was relieved when Devi did not pull away from the touch. Dawn was gone, the locket was probably burning a hole through the carpet, but Tara’s ribbon was still in her pocket. And Nellie knew that she deserved nice things.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="410" name="Don&#39;t Stop Devi" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Devi reached past Nellie, and she watched the girl, a distant part of her that belonged in this post-modern age screaming at her to do something, but that part wasn’t in control right now. 

Devi grabbed West’s grasping hand, but it was too late. She was too small, and his momentum was too strong. Nellie could not see Devi’s expression, just the back of a dark hoodie, those constant headphone’s resting on her neck like a noose. She did see West’s eyes widen as he realized what he was done, what he was doing, before he pulled both the crew members over the edge of the door, sending them tumbling into the Pit. 

It was right. It was what he deserved. It should have felt good.

She did not feel good. 

Was it because she lost Devi, too? That shouldn’t have mattered. Devi wasn’t Emma. All that should have mattered was that Mark was dead. Symbolically. That counted, right? It should have counted. 

She tried to listen, to hear screams from the Pit, or laughter telling her he was there and he was pleased, but she heard nothing. No music. No relief.

Nellie gasped, clutched at the locket that had grown red-hot, confused, angry, despairing. She grabbed the cheap jewellery, screaming as it burned her hand, ripping it from her throat, tearing the chain. She tossed it onto the ground. The object glowed, sizzling in the heat it produced. It sounded like it was hissing. It sounded like it was crying.

Nellie was alone in her body once more. Her limbs felt heavy, her bones almost loose now that there was no one to puppet them. She stumbled and fell to the carpet, her knees hitting the floor with a soft thud. She half lunged, half crawled to the door that opened easily under her hand, offering the gift of freedom, perhaps for a job well done.
Outside, Nellie stared at the closed door of the car. The keys were in Devi’s briefcase. Devi, and her briefcase, and her body, were at the bottom of the pit.

Nellie sat down, giving in to exhaustion and tears, leaning against the back of the door. When they didn’t check in at the hotel, maybe someone would call the police. Or the next group that had booked a tour. Or the owner, wondering why her payment didn’t come through, because Nellie knew for a fact that it did not. What would she say? “I was possessed by a ghost and killed my friends?”

No.

They were in the house, and there was an earthquake, that was what she would say. The door to the Séance Room broke and West fell through, and Devi died trying to save him. Only she got out. Only she survived to tell the tale to the police. To her subscribers.

Nellie’s eyes dried. She was going to get so many new subscribers. That would be nice. And after all that she had been through, Nellie deserved to have nice things.

[[Welcome to Bennington Mansion]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="412" name="Kill West" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">The locket burned hotter against her neck. 

“I’m sorry, Emma,” Nellie said, refusing to meet the ghost’s eyes. 

She lunged to push West through the door, and instead felt a sharp pressure against her back that sent her careening forward faster than she anticipated, past West. Her body was flung against the door whose fragile hinges immediately snapped under her weight, and she fell into the darkness of the Pit with a short shriek.

“What did you do?” Devi gasped, running towards the door, but West held her back from the edge before she could fall through, too.

“It would not have eased her rage,” Emma said, shaking her head. “This would have been just the beginning of a cycle of possession and sacrifice, innocent girls forced to murder innocent boys.”

“You just killed in innocent girl!” Devi shouted at her.

West looked conflicted, relief and shock keeping him frozen in place.

“I’m sorry about your friend,” Emma said, and though she sounded sincere Devi still raged in West unmoving grasp. “But this was the only way I could be certain to save this boy and ensure Dawn would never come back.”

“How can you know she’s gone for good?” West asked, his voice a sharp croak.

Emma’s face grew serious and West and Devi shivered. There were no shrieks coming from the Pit.

“There are secrets in Bennington Mansion that are not mine to tell,” Emma finally said. “Go, now. If something else comes for you, I won’t be able to save you again.”
As if to prove her warning, Emma’s body was already fading.

Devi let West lead her to the car outside and drive them away from Bennington Mansion, leaving Nellie, or whatever she had become, behind them. 

[[End of Track]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="413" name="Let it go" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">The locket went cold on Nellie’s neck and she gasped. For a moment it felt like she was suffocating, chocking on vomit that lodged in her windpipe, desperate to get out. Devi screamed and ran to her, grabbing her arm, and it was like the girl had unlocked some final door. Nellie’s jaw stretched and a rush of air escaped her. She fell back, caught by Devi and West before she hit the floor.

Briefly, Nellie thought she must have hit her head and was seeing double. But that woman who stood with Emma, still holding her hands, didn’t actually look anything like her. She was almost translucent, as was Emma now, but Nellie could still make out her feathered fringe. Though her eyes did not look sad, not anymore.

The ground began to shudder once more, the walls creaking, the hinges on the door to the Séance room snapping before the fragile wood fell into the Pit. A terrible noise rose up from the darkness that Nellie could not immediately identify as laughter. Emma and Dawn embraced, glancing fearfully around them.

“Go,” said Emma, her voice almost imperceptible. 

“What’s going on?” Nellie asked.

“There are secrets in Bennington Mansion that are not mine to tell,” Emma said. “Go, now. If something else comes for you, I won’t be able to save you again.”

As if to prove her warning, Emma and Dawn’s bodies disappeared completely.

Nellie let West and Devi hurry her to the car outside. They drove away from Bennington Mansion, leaving Dawn and Emma, and whatever resided in the Pit, behind them. 

[[End of Track]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="414" name="Listen to Dawn and Go to the Basement" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">“We should go down to the basement,” Devi said.

“Are you insane?” West asked, choking on a laugh.

“I’m with West on this one,” Nellie said, though Dawn grumbled and spat in her skull.
“Whatever is down there won’t let us leave until it’s satisfied,” said Devi. “It doesn’t matter if we run. If we don’t face what’s down there, we aren’t getting out.”

“Maybe Dawn is lying,” said West. “She could say anything just to get you guys to kill me.”

Nellie wanted to agree with West, it was a terrible idea, but the heat overwhelmed her and she found her lips moving on their own.

“I trust Devi’s opinion more than ours,” Nellie said.

West looked like he wanted to argue, but when Nellie grabbed Devi’s hand and ran into Bradford’s bedroom he followed, reluctant to be left behind alone. They hurried down the steps through the wardrobe as carefully as they could, but the light that emanated from below was even brighter now. They stumbled into the room and immediately found that they were not alone.

A man sat cross-legged on the altar.

Devi and West gasped, but Nellie could not get her body to respond. She felt Dawn’s excitement make her own hands tremble with anticipation. 

The man was handsome, in an unusual way. His skin was a little too pale, the color of someone naturally pale who has not seen sunlight in a very long time. He blinked slowly at them, and Nellie had the impression that he could not see them very well, if at all. At least, that was her impression until his eyes locked on her. His black hair was thick, pushed back from his forehead. It looked too long to Nellie, but it reminded her of the rockstars in the photos, stylish for another time. His black t-shirt and jeans were tight on his skinny frame, his studded thick boots looking too heavy for his body. He smiled at the crewmembers and Nellie wished she could look away, it was too bright, not with an actual light, but something worse that teased at the edges of her sight like the beginning of an aura migraine. Since she could not look away as long as Dawn had control of her body, Nellie had the time to count six distinct freckles that crossed his cheeks. 

“Who are you?” Devi whispered.

The man raised an eyebrow at Nellie, like they shared a secret, and she felt Dawn recoil from his smirk.

“Call me Versus,” the man said. “I’m surprised you don’t know, if you came down here.”
“Dawn’s ghost said-” 

Devi began, but the spirit possessing Nellie cut her off.

“I brought you a sacrifice,” she said. “Take him. He deserves it.”

West began to back up the stairs but froze suddenly, shivering. Devi’s body began shivering as well. Nellie could imagine the cold that held them in place, as cold as six dark stars in a distant constellation. 

“While fresh blood is always appealing, I have been waiting too long for what I was promised,” Versus said. 

His eyes went completely black, and there was the rush of air, like a vacuum opening into pure space. She and Dawn both grasped desperately at Devi, but the vacuum did not pull at their bodies. Versus was consuming their spirits. Both of their spirits. Nellie screamed with two voices, terrified, shrieking, before her body fell to the ground.
Devi fell to her knees beside Nellie, shaking the cooling body.

“Nellie! Nellie!”

“You killed her,” West said, his voice flat, expression wavering between fear and relief.
“I was really only after Dawn, but she bound her spirit so tightly to your companion, I hardly had a choice,” Versus said, his eyes vaguely human once more.

His voice slurred. He sounded drunk. Amused. 

“What are you going to do to us?” Devi asked, backing away from Nellie’s body to West.
“You’re lucky that consuming two lives leaves me… a little overfull,” he said, giggling, a grotesque inhuman sound. “If you run now, you could be quite far away before I grow hungry again.”

“You’d let us go?” West asked, incredulously.

“You’re welcome to stay,” Versus laughed. “But I’m not the only monster here that might kill you.”

West and Devi bounded up the stairs, leaving Nellie’s body with the laughing creature in the basement.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="415" name="Defy Dawn and Go to the Upper Observatory" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">“Dawn really doesn’t want to go to… the stars?”

“The observatory,” Devi said. “Upper floor of the library.”

“Then my vote is we go there,” said West. “If the murderous ghost doesn’t like it, then I’m a big fan.”

Nellie couldn’t think straight with Dawn still screaming in her head so she just nodded and followed Devi and West’s footsteps through the house, up the stairs, and into the room with the old unmade beds, the modern furniture, and the telescope. 
The house began to shake again.

“Maybe we should huddle in the doorframe?” Devi asked.

“We need to figure out what Dawn is so afraid of!” West argued. “I bet it can get rid of her and free Nellie.”

Nellie looked around the room and the locket flashed bright when she looked at the telescope. Good enough for her. She ignored what Dawn was hissing, the way the ghost was trying to take control of her limbs and peered through to look at the night sky.
Six stars. So clear. Shining far above them, bright and cold. 

The screaming was annoying now. An incessant buzzing, small gnats swatting at her ears.

Six stars. Closer now. No larger, but Nellie knew, if she reached out, she would be able to touch the constellation. 

The screaming didn’t even sound like Dawn now.

Six stars. It was definitely a constellation, but of what? Three women dancing, reaching out a hand to each other? Three children, bound by a rope of ice? Three crewmembers who were in over their heads? Or just six sharp white teeth?

Nellie could barely hear Devi and West’s screaming now.

Would the stars be cold to the touch? Her locket burned so hot, the kind of ice those stars promised would be a wonderful relief.

Nellie reached into the darkness, and the world went black.

[[End of Track]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="416" name="Ignore Devi and Follow the Music" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Nellie opened the door to the Groove Room. At the center of the dance floor stood a figure with dark almond eyes, cropped black hair, swaying slowly. She looked so alive, except for the slightly transparent nature of her skin. Nellie knew that the woman was singing a song that she had written herself. She could have been a folk singer, as influential as Joni Mitchell, as beloved as Karen Carpenter. Dawn had loved her, and she had the money, her family had the connections. It should have all worked out. They should have been happy. Instead…

Emma gave a small gasp when she saw Nellie, her song ending abruptly. The sad smile that had touched her lips turned warm and genuine. She reached out her hands and Nellie rushed forward to grasp them, not considering if her transparency meant she would be intangible. And perhaps she was. It was not Nellie’s hands she was holding, but the ghost who was hiding underneath her convenient skin. 

“Oh, Dawn,” Emma said. “I’ve been waiting here for so long.”

The locket went cold on Nellie’s neck and she gasped. For a moment it felt like she was suffocating, chocking on vomit that lodged in her windpipe, desperate to get out. Devi screamed and ran to her, grabbing her arm, and it was like the girl had unlocked some final door. Nellie’s jaw stretched and a rush of air escaped her. She fell back, caught by Devi and West before she hit the floor.

Briefly, Nellie thought she must have hit her head and was seeing double. But that woman who stood with Emma, still holding her hands, didn’t actually look anything like her. She was almost translucent, as was Emma now, but Nellie could still make out her feathered fringe. Though her eyes did not look sad, not anymore.

“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry I made you wait,” said Dawn, and though her voice was remorseful, the ghost couldn’t contain her grin. “Someone put my locket in the library, and I was trapped inside-”

Emma hushed her.

“We’re together now.”

Dawn’s eyes flickered down for a moment, and Nellie had the oddest feeling that she expected the earth to quake again.

“What about-” she began, but Emma cut her off.

“We’re together now,” she insisted. “Whatever happens in the future, happens. For now, we have each other. Thanks to them.”

Dawn looked sheepishly over her shoulder at the girl she possessed, pointedly avoiding looking at the boy she plotted to kill. 

“You should go,” she said to Nellie. “Compared to the other monsters in this mansion, I’m downright friendly.”

Nellie was overwhelmed by a wave of conflicting emotions. Happiness for these spirits. Disgust over the way Dawn had used her body. Frustration because she knew that West hadn’t filmed any of this, and it would have gotten them so many new subscribers. The crewmembers left the ghosts behind them to what they hoped would be an eternity of happiness and drove away from the Bennington mansion. 

[[End of Track]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="417" name="Ignore the Music and Follow Devi" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">Nellie stopped.

“Can we just, please, stop investigating the horrors?” Devi asked. “I don’t know what’s going on, but this is more than we have ever experienced on any other ghost hunt, and it’s obviously real, and dangerous, and I can’t imagine anything good coming from continuing to follow the creepy sounds back into the rooms of the mansion when we are so close to freedom.”

Freedom. Devi was right. She was so close.

She stepped away from the Groove Room, shaking her head, and the music faded before disappearing entirely.

Devi took her hand, gently, so warm and alive and real. Had her hands always been this soft? Or was she just finally able to appreciate it? Appreciate her. Quiet and always there beside her, prepared, careful, waiting. 

“Do you feel okay?” asked West, frowning. “Or are you… murder-y?”

“No, not anymore,” she said, offering a sheepish grin. “I’m so sorry. But after the way you’ve been needling me all night-”

“Gentle mocking is not the same as plotting a murder!” West yelled, but he was smiling a little too.

The music was gone, the ground was still, whatever had happened in the Gallery already felt far away. Devi was right that this was the most convincing haunt they had been on, but they had all seen videos online of haunts that looked equally convincing, ones the creators had secretly admitted were fake. The owner could have rigged this place. Weren’t the séances in the past all smoke and mirrors? Devi and West relaxed and grinned at Nellie.

“I think I got caught up in the moment,” she apologized. “This place is…”

“Yeah,” West agreed.

“By the way, did you manage to film any of our flight?”

“Absolutely not.”

The crewmembers left the mansion, piling into the car outside. Devi insisted on driving and also insisted that Nellie ride shotgun, because of the emotional turmoil, she claimed. West grumbled but got into the back seat. She kept her hand next to her, palm up, and was not surprised a few minutes into the drive when Devi intertwined their fingers, accepting the invitation. The mansion was behind them. The horrors still waited there, called to her, would probably lure her back again. But Emma was dead, and Devi was alive beside her. And while Nellie’s skin was an uncomfortable fit, she knew she could get used to it. She had gotten used to being trapped in a locket. This was a much more pleasant way to pass the afterlife, if she could only quiet the sounds of Nellie screaming inside her skull. 

[[End of Track]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="418" name="Forward Towards the Crashing Sound" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">The crewmembers ran into the hallway outside of Bradford’s room, and it was surprisingly intact. They heard another crashing sound, this time accompanied by a soft moan. It was coming from Tara’s bedroom.

“Do you think somebody’s in there?” Devi asked.

Before she was even done speaking, Nellie was throwing open the door. 

The room was in disarray. The bed had been flipped over, the drawers from the cabinet pulled out and tossed on the ground, where a woman with curly gray hair lay prone on her stomach, still moaning softly. Nellie didn’t know if she had tripped on one of the objects she had displaced or if she had fallen from exhaustion, and she didn’t care. 
“Guys, help me!”

Devi and West rushed in and immediately assisted Nellie in righting the woman, who staggered briefly before supporting herself against the doorframe. Nellie guessed the woman was in her sixties, but her eyes looked much older. Frightened. Tired. 

“Who are you?” Devi asked.

The woman glared at her like the question was impolite.

“You need to get out of here,” West said gently. “The building isn’t safe. Come with us.”
The woman’s eyes flicked past him then settled on Nellie before widening. No, not Nellie. The woman was looking at the diary in her hand.

She snatched it, flipping through the pages before impatiently opening the book towards the floor and shaking it. But whatever had been hidden inside was gone, lost somewhere in the Upper Observatory. The woman looked at them with fury.

“You fools,” she seethed, her voice paper dry and crackling with fury. 

She stepped out of the room and slammed the door behind her, leaving them in complete darkness. And Nellie heard the distinct sound of a lock clicking into place. The sound unfroze them from their shock. West rushed forward and tried the handle to no avail, then repeatedly slammed his shoulder into the wood. Nellie and Devi joined him, but they could not get this wood to budge. They were still trying to break out when the earth began to shake again. Briefly, Nellie thought she saw light in the darkness, six points of darkness forming a constellation. In the distance she heard Devi screaming her name. And then there was nothing at all. 

[[End of Track]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="419" name="Retreat from the Crashing Sound" tags="" position="375,1425" size="100,100">“Hello?” a voice called out. “Have you come back for me?”

“You all heard that, right?” asked West.

Nellie stared at the open wardrobe door, leading down into a darkness that did not seem so dark.

“Is someone down there?” Devi asked, shocked.

Nellie started forward, shaking off West’s attempt to hold her back.

“We can’t go down to the basement if the house is collapsing!” he shouted.

“We can’t leave someone in the basement if the house is collapsing!” Nellie shouted back.

“I’m with Nellie on this one,” said Devi.

“It might just be a ghost,” West insisted.

“West, on any of our investigations, when has a ghost actually talked to us in a full, easily understandable sentence?” Nellie asked.

West opened his mouth, snapped it shut, and followed Nellie and Devi down the stairs into the basement, where they found a man sitting cross-legged on the altar. 

“Tara?” the man asked, his voice cool and smooth.

He was handsome, in an unusual way. His skin was a little too pale, the color of someone naturally pale who has not seen sunlight in a very long time. His eyes were dark, either gray, brown, or blue, Nellie could not tell. He blinked slowly at them, and Nellie had the impression that he could not see them very well, if at all. At least, that was her impression until his eyes locked on her. His black hair was thick, pushed back from his forehead. It looked too long to Nellie, but it reminded her of the rockstars in the photos, stylish for another time. His black t-shirt and jeans were tight on his skinny frame, his studded thick boots looking too heavy for his body. He smiled at the crewmembers and Nellie wished she could look away, it was too bright, not with an actual light, but something worse that teased at the edges of her sight like the beginning of an aura migraine. 

“You’ve done something to your spirit, Tara, you clever witch,” the man said, his voice lilting with mockery. “Totally unrecognizable. But if you really wanted to hide, you would have left your precious diary behind. So you must think you have something to offer me that’s more enticing than what I’m due…”

Nellie looked down at the diary she held. It did not look so distinctive to her. She immediately regretted taking it. This man was not human and by coming down here with this book she seemed to have invited his undivided attention. 

“Have you reached out to me for a trade?” the man asked, leaning forward without moving from his seated position. “A couple of lives for a couple of lifetimes? I didn’t think you took an interest-”

“Hey, man, I’m sorry,” said Nellie. “I’m not looking for any kind of trade.”

The man cocked his head.

“I respect your resignation,” the man said. “Though it surprises me. You’ve always struck me as the brave and stupid type. It’s refreshing to be proven wrong.”

His eyes went completely black, and there was the rush of air, like a vacuum opening into pure space. A rush of wind whipped her clothes around her, but the vacuum did not pull in her body. It pulled a deeper place inside of her. Her spirit. Nellie shrieked, but only for a split second before her body fell to the ground.

“Holy shit,” said West. 

The man frowned, his eyes returning to their almost human state.

“Well, that wasn’t Tara,” he said.

West grabbed Devi’s hand and pulled her up the stairs.

“Consider yourselves lucky, wayward spirits,” the man called up to them, his laughter echoing even as they ran into the hall, and West swore he could hear it even as the door slammed behind him.

They jumped into the car and drove away. 

“Nellie’s dead,” Devi cried. “Nellie’s dead. She’s dead and we left her there!”

“If we had stayed, that thing would have killed us to,” West said. “He was right. We’re lucky.”

And as West thought about his future, maybe finding another production team, working with an actor who wasn’t Nellie, a terrible little part of him believed it was true.

“You fools,” she seethed, her voice paper dry and crackling with fury. 

She stepped out of the room and Nellie watched with horror as she grabbed the door, sure the old woman would slam it shut and send the ceiling, the walls, maybe the whole house crashing down on them. And then she froze. If she was furious before, Nellie did not have a word for what she was now. The woman pointed a long finger at Nellie.

“That’s MINE.”

Nellie was confused until she followed the woman’s gaze down to her jeans, where a white ribbon had come unravelled and trailed out of her pocket. Before the woman could say anything else, West rushed forward and bodychecked her, slamming her to the ground.

“What the HELL West?” Devi screamed.

“We do not have time for crazy old women who live in haunted mansions!” West screamed back.

Nellie agreed with West. She grabbed Devi’s hand, pulling her through the hallway, following her cameraman who she just realized was not filming any of this. They fled the mansion and jumped into the car, speeding away from their crime.

“Um, guys?” Nellie asked after several minutes had passed. “Did anything like… actually haunted happen? Or did we just attack and old woman and leave her in a structurally unsound building?”

Neither of her crewmembers answered.

Nellie turned on the radio and a familiar song began to play.

“Have you reached out to me for a trade?” the man asked, leaning forward without moving from his seated position. “A couple of lives for a couple of lifetimes? I didn’t think you took an interest in that side of the occult.”

Nellie hesitated. As long as this man assumed she was Tara, he would assume she had magic powers, apparently. Enough to trick him. Enough to earn a compliment. She might as well lean into the illusion. She pulled the white ribbon out of her pocket, the one she recognized on Tara in the family portrait, tying it around her hair. 

“What if I was looking to trade?” Nellie asked softly, hoping her voice wouldn’t give her away. “What would I need to do.”

“Littlest One, you’ve already done it,” the man laughed.

His eyes became completely dark and for a split second Nellie heard West and Devi scream. There was a sound like a rushing of air, and Nellie watched her crewmembers’ clothes whipping around them in a wind she could not feel, before they collapsed on the floor. Before Nellie could say anything, she felt something sour rising in her stomach, like bile, like vomit, but it refused to bubble up completely, leaving her full and sick and… drunk? She stumbled to the side, catching herself before she fell, and the man on the altar laughed.

“Sleep it off, Tara,” the man said. “You’ll feel better in the morning. Much better. You know, if you’re willing to continue the family tradition and keep bringing me little gifts, maybe we can continue to delay our eventual, mutual gratification.”

Nellie could barely pay attention to his lilting words. She somehow had the wherewithal to remember to grab the keys of Devi’s dead body before lurching up the steps, through the house, and out the front door. She didn’t know how far she drove before she crashed, but it hardly left a scratch. The sickness was starting to fade, and she felt invincible. She felt like she would live forever. Or at least, for two extra lifetimes.

West.”

“If anyone is touching things she shouldn’t, it’s Nellie!” West protested.

“Wow, just because of that accusation, I’m going to touch *everything*,” Nellie said, glaring at West.

“Guys, stop. Avoid the Séance door. If you’re really interested in that, we can get a view from the Upper Séance room, as long as you promise to be careful.”

“Careful?” West asked.

“You’ll see,” Devi said.

She waited for Nellie to ask her what she meant, but she had been distracted by the photographs lining the hallway’s walls. Devi signalled for West to film while she also explored the photos. The people in them looked familiar, and she assumed she must have seen them in the guidebook, or in the news, or in one of those faded tabloid magazines her mother would pull out to add visuals to an especially gruesome Bennington story, rife with human sacrifice and taboo sex. But while she did recognize an especially youthful looking Tara, her familiar curls held back in French braids, and a picture of Mark looking uncharacteristically happy, relaxed on a curved sofa between three men in ripped shirts strumming on guitars, she did not think the other people in the phots were particularly Bennington related. She paused at a photograph of Dawn, showing off her big-blue eyes under an impressively fluffy fringe, ignoring the man in extensive makeup who had tossed his arm over her shoulder in a misguided flirtatious move. The man… she had definitely seen him before…

“Is that David Bowie?” Devi finally asked.

Nellie startled next to her, as if she had not been looking at the same exact picture of the same exact famous popstar. 

“Oh shit, it is!” said West. “Holy shit, Mick Jagger’s in this pic!”

Devi realized that all those semi-familiar faces were rock, pop, and folk stars who reached their heights in the 70s. Some she knew continued to perform today, and some reached fates as tragic as any of the Bennington children. Nellie’s eyes were wide as she soaked them in, and Devi wondered if she was imagining her own potential success, her own news-worthy demise. Devi gently touched her shoulder and Nellie seemed to come out of her trance. 

“Where to next, boss?” West asked. “It looks like we have options.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="424" name="Groove Room – Devi&#39;s Tour" tags="" position="625,550" size="100,100">Devi stepped into the Groove Room, and though its green shaggy carpet was torn up, the wallpaper was peeling and damp, and the lazily turning disco ball didn’t reflect as much as it used to, in her mind, Devi was transported back in time. She had told the other crew members that her mother told her stories about the Bennington Mansion, nothing more than the urban legends anyone might know, but it was more than that. Her mother had been here. She had danced in this room, she had walked down the wide steps that led to the deeply indented dance floor. She had swung her hips next to Dawn and Mark and learned the vices and desires of the rock stars of their time. She had run through dark rooms with Tara, the only partier who had guessed she had lied about her age and was just as much a child as the youngest Bennington, and had learned about real darkness, more than shadows. The darkness of stars that had burnt out. The way you could hold their ash in your hand. Or else, that was how her mother described it. Devi always assumed there were drugs involved that her mother did not want to disclose that made the sparkling universe of a disco ball seem like constellations. Even now, the disco ball had lost most of its sparkle, content to reflect the poor light of the moon.

West passed by her, filming the disco ball, then closing in on the carpeted green stairs that led to the Upper Séance Room, before turning back to film Nellie who danced dreamily with an invisible partner on the dance floor.

“Oh, I’ll be waiting here
My lover, my lover
The world is far away
But I feel the soft skin of your hand…”

Devi listened intently to her headphones, ignored by her crew members. She could have been picking up a stray radio station, but she did not think so.

“Oh I’ll be waiting here,
My killer, my wonder
Your soul is far away
How much darkness can you stand?”

“What’s going on?” asked West, setting his camera on his shoulder.

“I might be picking something up.”

“Something spooky?”

It sounded more sad than spooky, but Devi nodded her head anyway. She thought it could be ghostly. Or she could make it sound ghostly in post. The sound faded away and Devi huffed.

“It’s gone now,” she said.

“West, did you film me dancing?” Nellie asked.

“Yes, of course,” West said, rolling his eyes. “Anything the guidebook wants us to know about this room?”

“This is the Groove Room,” Devi said, reading from the guidebook. “It was built at the request of Bennington’s children and used during all of their parties. It had the best acoustics and was sometimes rented out as a studio space, but since this business venture was informal, we do not know what celebrities might have recorded here. While the ground floor was popular with disco dancers and musicians, the upper floor was reserved for the children’s more intimate activities. However, an earthquake caused extensive damage to the upper floor, and it is not open for tours.”

“There’s nothing blocking the stairs now,” said West.

“We have to up, Devi,” said Nellie. “We just started exploring!”

[[Upper Séance Room - Devi&#39;s Tour (Cont. from GR)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="425" name="Girls’ Bathroom – Devi’s Tour" tags="" position="625,550" size="100,100">The salmon pink of the tiles, toilet, and tub were aggressively girly, in a way that hurt Devi’s eyes, the same sort of pang she got in her teeth when she ate equally pink icing on cupcakes. Devi’s mother told her stories about how Tara hated the girliness Bradford’s lovers pushed on her in some misguided attempt to keep her under their influence, away from Bradford’s occult concerns. As if enforced sweetness would equal compliance. No girl could ever live up to the sweetness of this pink. It was a mocking color, condescending and oppressive.

“Looks like a bathroom,” said West, nodding officially to himself.

Devi opened the guidebook, happy to look away from the walls, while West filmed Nellie looking pensively at the tile.

“This is the Girls’ Bathroom,” said Devi. “While it was open to the public during parties, guests for the more private occult viewings, and eventually customers on tours, while this mansion was strictly a private residence it was shared by the five female Benningtons: Bradford’s three lovers as well as his two daughters. The men had their own private bathrooms, and this forced sharing created tension in an already tense household. The women in Bradford’s life did not get along. Dawn generally avoided the company of the lovers, including her own mother, and Tara was closest with Bradford even in her childhood. The lovers resented their daughters’ dismissal, and there were several incidents of fights breaking out over time spent in the shower, fights that reached such heights that the police were called for de-escalation on at least five separate occasions. Eventually, Tara would share a bathroom with her father and Dawn would use Mark’s bathroom during his frequent forays away from the mansion and his family. But officially, this bathroom would always be known as the Girls’ Bathroom.”

“I bet he called his lovers his ‘girls,’” Nellie said, adjusting her sharp bangs in the cracked mirror. “He seems like the kind of misogynist who would do that.”

“Free love isn’t necessarily misogynistic,” West said, but he did not argue further after Nellie snorted a derisive laugh.

“If you want bathroom footage, you’ll have to film here,” Devi said, mostly to stop the fight before it began. “There was an issue with the plumbing about ten years ago and Bradford and Mark’s private bathrooms got wrecked. The owner sealed them shut. We’ll see the doors in their bedrooms, but that’s it. I’m not picking anything up on the mics, but if any of this looks particularly compelling to you, we can have a closer look.”

They wandered away from the photographs of the rock stars. Devi wondered if her mother had met any of them during her secret trips to the Bennington Mansion. Maybe it was best that she didn’t know any of those stories. They would probably be hard to pass off as cautionary tales or urban legends that she had no personal connection to. Plus, she didn’t like to think of her mother partying with rock stars, and what that might have entailed.

“You alright, Devi?” West asked.

“Yeah,” Devi said, shrugging. 

“Is anyone else chilly?” Nellie asked and Devi relaxed as the star drew West’s attention away from her.

“Nope,” said West. “Maybe it’s a ghost?”

“West. Film,” Nellie demanded, before turning to the red light and smirking. “I think we have company, viewers. Does anyone want to make contact? It’s safe here. We’re listening.”

Despite the silliness of its name, Spooktacular Investigations didn’t use EVP, radio channels, any of the tricks popular on other streaming shows because as far as Nellie was concerned, they were just tricks. And Devi didn’t mind. Fewer recordings to make sense of later, and none of that terrible static some of those machines made while the hapless investigators pretended they could hear sentences formed between the white noise. All three of the crew members had a history of paranormal connection, and none of them had needed tricks or special gear. Well, Devi had kind of lied about her history. It was her mother’s history, right here, at the mansion. Maybe it wasn’t as personal as West’s experience with his grandmother or Nellie’s - 

“Guess they’re shy,” Nellie said, shrugging at the camera. “We’ve got some chilly, shy ghosts or demons in the mansion.”

“Maybe I should play ‘Running With the Devil,’” Devi suggested. 

“Only if we’re desperate for contact,” Nellie said. “Okay Devi, I’ve had enough of this popcorn ceiling for a lifetime. What does the guidebook say?”

Devi flipped open the book.

“These three bedrooms belonged to Bradford’s children,” Devi said. “They moved in during their adulthood, except for Tara, who was teenager when construction was completed. Their rooms are marked with their initials above their doors…”

The crew members all looked up at the molding mantels above each door, where pieces of metal twisted into the shape of a letter were still securely nailed: M, T, D.

“What’s the plan, Devi?” asked West. “We probably have time to explore two of the rooms.”

She had told the other crew members that her mother told her stories about the Bennington Mansion, nothing more than the urban legends anyone might know, but it was more than that. Her mother had been here. She had danced in this room, she had walked down the wide steps that led to the deeply indented dance floor. She had swung her hips next to Dawn and Mark and learned the vices and desires of the rock stars of their time. She had run through dark rooms with Tara, the only partier who had guessed she had lied about her age and was just as much a child as the youngest Bennington, and had learned about real darkness, more than shadows. The darkness of stars that had burnt out. The way you could hold their ash in your hand. Or else, that was how her mother described it. Devi always assumed there were drugs involved that her mother did not want to disclose that made the sparkling universe of a disco ball seem like constellations. Even now, the disco ball had lost most of its sparkle, content to reflect the poor light of the moon.

West passed by her, filming the disco ball, then closing in on the carpeted green stairs that led to the Upper Séance Room, before turning back to film Nellie who danced dreamily with an invisible partner on the dance floor.

“Oh, I’ll be waiting here
My lover, my lover
The world is far away
But I feel the soft skin of your hand…”

Devi listened intently to her headphones, ignored by her crew members. She could have been picking up a stray radio station, but she did not think so.

“Oh I’ll be waiting here,
My killer, my wonder
Your soul is far away
How much darkness can you stand?”

“What’s going on?” asked West, setting his camera on his shoulder.

“I might be picking something up.”

“Something spooky?”

It sounded more sad than spooky, but Devi nodded her head anyway. She thought it could be ghostly. Or she could make it sound ghostly in post. The sound faded away and Devi huffed.

“It’s gone now,” she said.

“West, did you film me dancing?” Nellie asked.

“Yes, of course,” West said, rolling his eyes. “Anything the guidebook wants us to know about this room?”

“This is the Groove Room,” Devi said, reading from the guidebook. “It was built at the request of Bennington’s children and used during all of their parties. It had the best acoustics and was sometimes rented out as a studio space, but since this business venture was informal, we do not know what celebrities might have recorded here. While the ground floor was popular with disco dancers and musicians, the upper floor was reserved for the children’s more intimate activities. However, an earthquake caused extensive damage to the upper floor, and it is not open for tours.”

“There’s nothing blocking the stairs now,” said West.

“It’s up to you, Devi,” said Nellie. “We can go up or keep exploring on the not damaged level.”

“I didn’t know this was the door to the Pit,” West protested as he stepped back. “It looks like all the other doors. But, yeah, way more rotted. I bet I could kick it down.”

“It’s so rotted I could kick it down,” Nellie said, squaring up like she was about to try.

Devi grabbed her hand, blushed, and let it go.

“No one’s kicking down any doors,” she said, quietly, but firmly.

“We were just joking, Devi,” West grinned. “Lead the way.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="442" name="Upper Séance Room - Devi&#39;s Tour (Cont. from GBR)" tags="" position="625,550" size="100,100">Devi immediately regretted encouraging her crew members to explore the upper floor when they saw the large hole in the floor leading down to the even bigger hole of the séance pit and chose to lean over it as far as they could manage.

“Please step away from the edge of the Pit,” Devi said, not surprised when neither Nellie or West moved.

“I need to get the best footage,” West said.

“The best footage involves me looking like I’m in imminent danger,” Nellie agreed.

“Looking like, not actually being in,” Devi protested, but they ignored her. She pulled out the guidebook and read from the room’s official entry, understanding why it was meant to be read from the safety of the Groove Room. “An earthquake at the time caused structural damage to a lot of the mansion and is said to have upset some poorly made support beams that collapsed, making the center of the floor collapse. But some people think there was an explosion of dark energy after a séance went wrong, and the explosion caused the hole. It was in the papers. And my mom remembered it.”

Devi bit her tongue. Her mother remembered it because she was there. She and Tara had been in the Upper Séance Room, had looked down and seen… it could have been party guests, but her mother had always assumed the three women in the Séance Room were Bradford’s lovers. There was an object on the table, some kind of doll, and they were chanting something. Her mother said she wanted to leave, but Tara was mesmerized. And then… nothing. Her mother didn’t remember the explosion. She was just suddenly outside, and a fireman was wrapping a blanket over her shoulders. 

“Doesn’t look burnt…” Nellie murmured as she touched the edge of the green carpet, torn and drooping towards the darkness below.

“Maybe dark energy doesn’t burn,” West said. “Most of the dark energy we’ve faced has been cold.”

Devi’s mic began to pick something up again, and Devi listened for the music, but instead she heard… footsteps? It was hard to hear over West and Nellie arguing, but they were definitely footsteps. Coming from where? It was like they were coming from the wall, but there was no room on the other side of this wall. And then the sound stopped. Devi held her breath, but there were no more footsteps. It didn’t really matter. In post, footsteps were indistinguishable from old plumbing, or a branch knocked about by wind. The audience wouldn’t care. Devi decided it was a ghost, but it was not the first ghost she had encountered that never made the final cut. 

“Let’s go guys,” she said. “If we stay here any longer, one of you is going to fall in the Pit.”

They wandered away from the photographs of the rock stars in the hallway. Devi wondered if her mother had met any of them during her secret trips to the Bennington Mansion. Maybe it was best that she didn’t know any of those stories. They would probably be hard to pass off as cautionary tales or urban legends that she had no personal connection to. Plus, she didn’t like to think of her mother partying with rock stars, and what that might have entailed.

“You alright, Devi?” West asked.

“Yeah,” Devi said, shrugging. &quot;It&#39;s just, my mic keeps picking up these sounds like footsteps coming from the walls.&quot;

&quot;Could be ghost steps,&quot; West said. &quot;Or rats. Or support beams giving way.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s hope for ghosts,&quot; Devi shuddered. 

“Is anyone else chilly?” Nellie asked.

“Nope,” said West. “Maybe it’s a ghost?”

“West. Film,” Nellie demanded, before turning to the red light and smirking. “I think we have company, viewers. Does anyone want to make contact? It’s safe here. We’re listening.”

Despite the silliness of its name, Spooktacular Investigations didn’t use EVP, radio channels, any of the tricks popular on other streaming shows because as far as Nellie was concerned, they were just tricks. And Devi didn’t mind. Fewer recordings to make sense of later, and none of that terrible static some of those machines made while the hapless investigators pretended they could hear sentences formed between the white noise. All three of the crew members had a history of paranormal connection, and none of them had needed tricks or special gear. Well, Devi had kind of lied about her history. It was her mother’s history, right here, at the mansion. Maybe it wasn’t as personal as West’s experience with his grandmother or Nellie’s -

Devi’s mother told her stories about how Tara hated the girliness Bradford’s lovers pushed on her in some misguided attempt to keep her under their influence, away from Bradford’s occult concerns. As if enforced sweetness would equal compliance. No girl could ever live up to the sweetness of this pink. It was a mocking color, condescending and oppressive.

“Looks like a bathroom,” said West, nodding officially to himself.

Devi opened the guidebook, happy to look away from the walls, while West filmed Nellie looking pensively at the tile.

“This is the Girls’ Bathroom,” said Devi. “While it was open to the public during parties, guests for the more private occult viewings, and eventually customers on tours, while this mansion was strictly a private residence it was shared by the five female Benningtons: Bradford’s three lovers as well as his two daughters. The men had their own private bathrooms, and this forced sharing created tension in an already tense household. The women in Bradford’s life did not get along. Dawn generally avoided the company of the lovers, including her own mother, and Tara was closest with Bradford even in her childhood. The lovers resented their daughters’ dismissal, and there were several incidents of fights breaking out over time spent in the shower, fights that reached such heights that the police were called for de-escalation on at least five separate occasions. Eventually, Tara would share a bathroom with her father and Dawn would use Mark’s bathroom during his frequent forays away from the mansion and his family. But officially, this bathroom would always be known as the Girls’ Bathroom.”

“I bet he called his lovers his ‘girls,’” Nellie said, adjusting her sharp bangs in the cracked mirror. “He seems like the kind of misogynist who would do that.”

“Free love isn’t necessarily misogynistic,” West said, but he did not argue further after Nellie snorted a derisive laugh.

“If you want bathroom footage, you’ll have to film here,” Devi said, mostly to stop the fight before it began. “There was an issue with the plumbing about ten years ago and Bradford and Mark’s private bathrooms got wrecked. The owner sealed them shut. We’ll see the doors in their bedrooms, but that’s it. I’m not picking anything up on the mics, but if any of this looks particularly compelling to you, we can have a closer look.”

“I… I probably wouldn’t have touched it,” West said, filming the sludge intently.

Devi’s mother told her stories about how Tara hated the girliness Bradford’s lovers pushed on her in some misguided attempt to keep her under their influence, away from Bradford’s occult concerns. As if enforced sweetness would equal compliance. No girl could ever live up to the sweetness of this pink. It was a mocking color, condescending and oppressive.

“Looks like a bathroom,” said West, nodding officially to himself.

Devi opened the guidebook, happy to look away from the walls, while West filmed Nellie looking pensively at the tile.

“This is the Girls’ Bathroom,” said Devi. “While it was open to the public during parties, guests for the more private occult viewings, and eventually customers on tours, while this mansion was strictly a private residence it was shared by the five female Benningtons: Bradford’s three lovers as well as his two daughters. The men had their own private bathrooms, and this forced sharing created tension in an already tense household. The women in Bradford’s life did not get along. Dawn generally avoided the company of the lovers, including her own mother, and Tara was closest with Bradford even in her childhood. The lovers resented their daughters’ dismissal, and there were several incidents of fights breaking out over time spent in the shower, fights that reached such heights that the police were called for de-escalation on at least five separate occasions. Eventually, Tara would share a bathroom with her father and Dawn would use Mark’s bathroom during his frequent forays away from the mansion and his family. But officially, this bathroom would always be known as the Girls’ Bathroom.”

“I bet he called his lovers his ‘girls,’” Nellie said, adjusting her sharp bangs in the cracked mirror. “He seems like the kind of misogynist who would do that.”

“Free love isn’t necessarily misogynistic,” West said, but he did not argue further after Nellie snorted a derisive laugh.

“If you want bathroom footage, you’ll have to film here,” Devi said, mostly to stop the fight before it began. “There was an issue with the plumbing about ten years ago and Bradford and Mark’s private bathrooms got wrecked. The owner sealed them shut. We’ll see the doors in their bedrooms, but that’s it. I’m not picking anything up on the mics, but if any of this looks particularly compelling to you, we can have a closer look.”

“Yes, Nellie, obviously.”

The room was very dark. It was sandwiched between the hall and Dawn’s room, so there were no porthole windows to let in the scant starlight that lit the rest of the house. But even in the dull glow of the camera’s light, it was clear that this room had been spared the years of rot and disrepair they had seen elsewhere in the mansion. The bed even looked freshly made, turned down, ready for an occupant to slip inside. There was a teddy bear on a pillow. Edward. That was what Tara named him. She still slept with him well into her teen years. When Devi’s mother snuck into the Bennington parties, she always hoped Tara would find her, take her exploring through those mysterious hallways that only she could navigate, toting Edward along with her. Her mother made it sound like Tara conjured the halls out of thin air, but Devi assumed there were enough substances filling the air on those cool desert nights to make any trip on a back stairway seem like a miraculous journey to the stars. 

She was not sure what to make of her mother’s other stories, the ones where she and Tara hid behind cracked doors and watched as the Benningtons spoke to… something. Someone terrible, a man her mother never fully described. She never said what he did to Bradford, to his lovers, to Mark. She just said Dawn made sure to stay away from him, and Tara could never resist sneaking closer and closer until the day she was fully brought into the fold, leaving her mother on the other side of a firmly shut door. 

Her mother said the terrible creature was not a man. Not a ghost. Not a demon. Something else. Devi had been chasing him for years, a face to put to her mother’s memory. She did not know why she couldn’t dismiss the man in the same way she dismissed the magical hallways. 

“You should get in the bed,” West whispered to Nellie.

“I am not getting in the bed,” Nellie whispered back.

“Guys, please don’t whisper,” Devi sighed. “The mics won’t pick you up if you keep whispering.”

“Sorry, Devi,” said Nellie.

Devi flipped to Tara’s page in the guidebook. 

“This room belonged to Tara, Bradford’s youngest child. She moved into the house when she was thirteen, and though her mother tried to keep them separate, Bradford immediately inducted her into the world of dark arts. They would spend hours, sometimes days in his secret study, communing with dark forces. She was known to have fits of demonic possession during public get togethers, though her siblings insisted she performed these tricks because she was incredibly shy and it was an easy way to get back to her room or the library or to hide with her mother who also hated social events. After her siblings died and Bradford’s lovers abandoned him, Tara stayed, taking care of her father well into his old age. She was supposedly at his side when he died…”

Devi paused. The rest of the entry implied that Tara had killed him for her own dark purposes, to take revenge or gain power. It was a good story for a ghostly investigation. But she felt Edward’s button eyes on her, the same ones that watched her mother as the girls ran through magical hallways. She closed the book, smiling at West and Nellie like there was nothing else on the page.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="475" name="Dawn&#39;s Room - Devi&#39;s Tour" tags="" position="625,800" size="100,100">Devi had heard stories from her mother about Dawn’s temper. Usually Dawn would play it cool during the parties that Devi’s mother attended, but every so often something would happen to set her off. The something was usually Mark. And once Dawn was screaming, she was throwing things, and breaking chairs, and shattering glasses. So, though the room could have been wrecked recently by vandals, Devi suspected that the gouged walls, scratched bedposts, and crushed sparkling jewels on the ground were the remains of Dawn’s final tantrum. 

“Do you think someone stole the sheets?” West asked.

“Oh, you don’t know the legend about Dawn!” Devi gasped.

“We have established that, no, I don’t know the legend,” West said before mumbling. “Don’t think I want to, but I’m sure I’ll learn it soon enough.”

Devi flipped through the guidebook as West casually filmed Nellie who was piecing through the jewellery on the floor, not with the intent to steal it. Devi didn’t know what her intent was. But the meticulous way she seemed to be searching through the jewellery was unsettling. She read quickly. 

“Dawn was Bradford’s oldest daughter. She grew up in Mississippi with her mother, one of Bradford’s lovers. It was this lover who had encouraged him to build the Bennington Mansion for the whole family. The press described Dawn as a Southern Belle, or a Peach Flower forced to live as a Cactus. She was sweet to her friends and family but downright prickly to anyone who came courting. However, rumor has it that she did fall in love, and not with one of those rich Hollywood types that were always shmoozing with Bradford on the estate or cozying up to her brother with their wild lives. She met a folksinger named Emma who snuck into one of their parties because she heard that Janis Ian was there. Emma didn’t meet Janis, but she did meet Dawn. They kept their relationship a secret because they were worried how Dawn’s family would react to this poor prospect, an unknown outsider with no ties to the family through wealth, celebrity, or even occult interests. When Mark discovered their romance, he told her father, and Bradford forbade Dawn from ever seeing Emma again. Some say he arranged for Emma to be murdered or sacrificed her to a dark spirit in order to ensure the continued wealth of the family. Whatever her fate, she disappeared in the summer of 1978. Mere weeks later, her sister Tara would tell the police that she thought she heard Dawn come into her room in the middle of the night and felt her gently kiss her on the forehead before she took the sheets from her bed, went to the Upper Séance room, and hanged herself.”

“Nel, did you need a sec? Or a tissue?” West asked, surprisingly genuine.

“No,” Nellie said. “It’s just… dusty.” 

Devi’s mother told her that she had never seen a person in real life or on film who was as beautiful as Dawn Bennington. She also said that the papers had it wrong. They thought that Emma’s death caused Dawn’s depression. But Dawn had always carried that sadness in her, along with her rage and her joy, every emotion at full throttle all the time. It was Emma who cooled her woes and her temper, her rages and her joys. Without Emma to carry her, what else could Dawn do but fall? 

Before they moved on, Nellie picked up the jewellery and set it on the remains of a vanity, a neat line of broken memories in front of a mirror with only a few smashed pieces left in its frame.

The purple paisley wallpaper wet and peeling, oozing a brown sludge seemed to have seeped into everything it touched. The walls, the bed, the carpet, and the few personal items left in the room had all gone soft, like a half-chewed meal spat out by a cranky child. The ooze was at its thickest by a door at the far end of the room. Devi was not tempted to look behind it, and even if her more adventurous crew members wanted to, it was nailed shut with large pieces of wood. Everything else, from the soggy remains of poster drooping from nails in the wall, to the marshy remains of a bedspread on the once proud and now rotting wooden frame, had been taken over by the sludge.

“Don’t touch anything, even if you think it would be hilarious, this place looks toxic,” Devi said, hand covering her nose and mouth. “The owner said the men’s bathrooms were… well I was not prepared for this.”

“West, camera on me, we’re going to be quick about this,” Nellie said, trying not to look too disgusted as she peered thoughtfully at the sogging decay.

Devi flipped through the guidebook until she found the page for Mark. 

“Mark was the second son and biggest disappointment of Bradford’s three children. He had little interest in his father’s occult activities and Bradford’s lovers encouraged him to find a life outside of their strange home. However, Mark chose to bring the rock star crowd that welcomed him back to the mansion, finding less independence than his family might have hoped. Mark was a songwriter, and his guitar is still preserved in his bedroom, in the corner it rarely left once the Bennington son found more excitement in the lifestyle of musicians than in his own music. He often mocked his father for his beliefs in spirits and demonic forces, spreading rumors in the press that most reporters believed were greatly exaggerated, though their suspicions never stopped them from printing Mark’s tall tales of human sacrifice and portals to Hell. Several times Bradford tried to cut him off, demanding that he make his own way in the world, but his more sympathetic family members always welcomed this prodigal son’s frequent returns. Police reported that one night his sisters both heard their father and brother yelling at each other, though whether they fought in Bradford’s bedroom or the kitchen was uncertain. This uncertainty would prove a boon to the elder Bradford, casting doubt on his daughters’ memories and therefore doubt on his possible involvement in his son’s disappearance. Bradford was screaming at Mark to leave their house for good, and the next morning Mark was gone. But not left, vanished. Immediate landscaping on the Bennington garden led to speculation that Bradford had killed him and buried him on the property. Some investigators claim they can hear sounds like muffled screams when they walk through the garden, pounding like it’s coming from beneath their feet. It’s been suggested he was buried alive.”

“Devi, I can’t take anymore,” said Nellie gagging. 

“Wait, does anyone see that guitar?” West asked.

The crew members looked at the misshapen piles of sludge around the room. Devi supposed any of those piles could have been a guitar at one point. Nellie shrugged at West and they followed her hurried retreat from the room. 

Devi’s mother did tell her that Mark once screamed at Tara for touching his guitar. She wondered what he would have thought about the state of his beloved instrument now.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="477" name="Dawn&#39;s Room - Devi&#39;s Tour (from Tara&#39;s/Mark&#39;s Room)" tags="" position="725,800" size="100,100">Devi had heard stories from her mother about Dawn’s temper. Usually Dawn would play it cool during the parties that Devi’s mother attended, but every so often something would happen to set her off. The something was usually Mark. And once Dawn was screaming, she was throwing things, and breaking chairs, and shattering glasses. So, though the room could have been wrecked recently by vandals, Devi suspected that the gouged walls, scratched bedposts, and crushed sparkling jewels on the ground were the remains of Dawn’s final tantrum. 

“Do you think someone stole the sheets?” West asked.

“Oh, you don’t know the legend about Dawn!” Devi gasped.

“We have established that, no, I don’t know the legend,” West said before mumbling. “Don’t think I want to, but I’m sure I’ll learn it soon enough.”

Devi flipped through the guidebook as West casually filmed Nellie who was piecing through the jewellery on the floor, not with the intent to steal it. Devi didn’t know what her intent was. But the meticulous way she seemed to be searching through the jewellery was unsettling. She read quickly. 

“Dawn was Bradford’s oldest daughter. She grew up in Mississippi with her mother, one of Bradford’s lovers. It was this lover who had encouraged him to build the Bennington Mansion for the whole family. The press described Dawn as a Southern Belle, or a Peach Flower forced to live as a Cactus. She was sweet to her friends and family but downright prickly to anyone who came courting. However, rumor has it that she did fall in love, and not with one of those rich Hollywood types that were always shmoozing with Bradford on the estate or cozying up to her brother with their wild lives. She met a folksinger named Emma who snuck into one of their parties because she heard that Janis Ian was there. Emma didn’t meet Janis, but she did meet Dawn. They kept their relationship a secret because they were worried how Dawn’s family would react to this poor prospect, an unknown outsider with no ties to the family through wealth, celebrity, or even occult interests. When Mark discovered their romance, he told her father, and Bradford forbade Dawn from ever seeing Emma again. Some say he arranged for Emma to be murdered or sacrificed her to a dark spirit in order to ensure the continued wealth of the family. Whatever her fate, she disappeared in the summer of 1978. Mere weeks later, her sister Tara would tell the police that she thought she heard Dawn come into her room in the middle of the night and felt her gently kiss her on the forehead before she took the sheets from her bed, went to the Upper Séance room, and hanged herself.”

“Nel, did you need a sec? Or a tissue?” West asked, surprisingly genuine.

“No,” Nellie said. “It’s just… dusty.” 

Devi’s mother told her that she had never seen a person in real life or on film who was as beautiful as Dawn Bennington. She also said that the papers had it wrong. They thought that Emma’s death caused Dawn’s depression. But Dawn had always carried that sadness in her, along with her rage and her joy, every emotion at full throttle all the time. It was Emma who cooled her woes and her temper, her rages and her joys. Without Emma to carry her, what else could Dawn do but fall? 

Before they moved on, Nellie picked up the jewellery and set it on the remains of a vanity, a neat line of broken memories in front of a mirror with only a few smashed pieces left in its frame. 

Nellie paused. There was something sticking out of the vanity’s top drawer. She tugged it free, reading the faded lines.

“Hey, guys, I think I found a poem.”

“Give a dead woman some privacy, Nellie,” said West. “We should go on.”

[[Dawn&#39;s Poem - Devi&#39;s Tour]]

[[Library - Devi&#39;s Tour]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="478" name="Mark&#39;s Room - Devi&#39;s Tour (from Dawn&#39;s/Tara&#39;s Room)" tags="" position="725,800" size="100,100">Devi’s mother didn’t have many stories about Mark from those days when she would party at the Bennington Mansion, and she definitely hadn’t gone into Mark’s bedroom, but even if she did not have first-person witness testimony, Devi doubted it had looked like this in its heyday. The purple paisley wallpaper wet and peeling, oozing a brown sludge seemed to have seeped into everything it touched. The walls, the bed, the carpet, and the few personal items left in the room had all gone soft, like a half-chewed meal spat out by a cranky child. The ooze was at its thickest by a door at the far end of the room. Devi was not tempted to look behind it, and even if her more adventurous crew members wanted to, it was nailed shut with large pieces of wood. Everything else, from the soggy remains of poster drooping from nails in the wall, to the marshy remains of a bedspread on the once proud and now rotting wooden frame, had been taken over by the sludge.

“Don’t touch anything, even if you think it would be hilarious, this place looks toxic,” Devi said, hand covering her nose and mouth. “The owner said the men’s bathrooms were… well I was not prepared for this.”

“West, camera on me, we’re going to be quick about this,” Nellie said, trying not to look too disgusted as she peered thoughtfully at the sogging decay.

Devi flipped through the guidebook until she found the page for Mark. 

“Mark was the second son and biggest disappointment of Bradford’s three children. He had little interest in his father’s occult activities and Bradford’s lovers encouraged him to find a life outside of their strange home. However, Mark chose to bring the rock star crowd that welcomed him back to the mansion, finding less independence than his family might have hoped. Mark was a songwriter, and his guitar is still preserved in his bedroom, in the corner it rarely left once the Bennington son found more excitement in the lifestyle of musicians than in his own music. He often mocked his father for his beliefs in spirits and demonic forces, spreading rumors in the press that most reporters believed were greatly exaggerated, though their suspicions never stopped them from printing Mark’s tall tales of human sacrifice and portals to Hell. Several times Bradford tried to cut him off, demanding that he make his own way in the world, but his more sympathetic family members always welcomed this prodigal son’s frequent returns. Police reported that one night his sisters both heard their father and brother yelling at each other, though whether they fought in Bradford’s bedroom or the kitchen was uncertain. This uncertainty would prove a boon to the elder Bradford, casting doubt on his daughters’ memories and therefore doubt on his possible involvement in his son’s disappearance. Bradford was screaming at Mark to leave their house for good, and the next morning Mark was gone. But not left, vanished. Immediate landscaping on the Bennington garden led to speculation that Bradford had killed him and buried him on the property. Some investigators claim they can hear sounds like muffled screams when they walk through the garden, pounding like it’s coming from beneath their feet. It’s been suggested he was buried alive.”

“Devi, I can’t take anymore,” said Nellie gagging. 

“Wait, does anyone see that guitar?” West asked.

The crew members looked at the misshapen piles of sludge around the room. Devi supposed any of those piles could have been a guitar at one point. Devi’s mother did tell her that Mark once screamed at Tara for touching his guitar. She wondered what he would have thought about the state of his beloved instrument now.

West frowned as he stared at piece of the bedframe that had not completely rotted.

“There’s some kind of message scratched on here,” West said, leaning down to read it more closely.

“West, do not touch the rotten wood,” Devi chided. “Let’s go.”

[[Mark&#39;s Message - Devi&#39;s Tour]]

[[Library - Devi&#39;s Tour]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="479" name="Tara&#39;s Room - Devi&#39;s Tour (from Dawn&#39;s/Mark&#39;s Room)" tags="" position="725,800" size="100,100">“Holy crap, West, you’re recording this, right?”

“Yes, Nellie, obviously.”

The room was very dark. It was sandwiched between the hall and Dawn’s room, so there were no porthole windows to let in the scant starlight that lit the rest of the house. But even in the dull glow of the camera’s light, it was clear that this room had been spared the years of rot and disrepair they had seen elsewhere in the mansion. The bed even looked freshly made, turned down, ready for an occupant to slip inside. There was a teddy bear on a pillow. Edward. That was what Tara named him. She still slept with him well into her teen years. When Devi’s mother snuck into the Bennington parties, she always hoped Tara would find her, take her exploring through those mysterious hallways that only she could navigate, toting Edward along with her. Her mother made it sound like Tara conjured the halls out of thin air, but Devi assumed there were enough substances filling the air on those cool desert nights to make any trip on a back stairway seem like a miraculous journey to the stars. 

She was not sure what to make of her mother’s other stories, the ones where she and Tara hid behind cracked doors and watched as the Benningtons spoke to… something. Someone terrible, a man her mother never fully described. She never said what he did to Bradford, to his lovers, to Mark. She just said Dawn made sure to stay away from him, and Tara could never resist sneaking closer and closer until the day she was fully brought into the fold, leaving her mother on the other side of a firmly shut door. 

Her mother said the terrible creature was not a man. Not a ghost. Not a demon. Something else. Devi had been chasing him for years, a face to put to her mother’s memory. She did not know why she couldn’t dismiss the man in the same way she dismissed the magical hallways. 

“You should get in the bed,” West whispered to Nellie.

“I am not getting in the bed,” Nellie whispered back.

“Guys, please don’t whisper,” Devi sighed. “The mics won’t pick you up if you keep whispering.”

“Sorry, Devi,” said Nellie.

Devi flipped to Tara’s page in the guidebook. 

“This room belonged to Tara, Bradford’s youngest child. She moved into the house when she was thirteen, and though her mother tried to keep them separate, Bradford immediately inducted her into the world of dark arts. They would spend hours, sometimes days in his secret study, communing with dark forces. She was known to have fits of demonic possession during public get togethers, though her siblings insisted she performed these tricks because she was incredibly shy and it was an easy way to get back to her room or the library or to hide with her mother who also hated social events. After her siblings died and Bradford’s lovers abandoned him, Tara stayed, taking care of her father well into his old age. She was supposedly at his side when he died…”

Devi paused. The rest of the entry implied that Tara had killed him for her own dark purposes, to take revenge or gain power. It was a good story for a ghostly investigation. But she felt Edward’s button eyes on her, the same ones that watched her mother as the girls ran through magical hallways. She closed the book, smiling at West and Nellie like there was nothing else on the page. 

West and Nellie shared a shrug and turned to leave.

“Wait,” said Devi, crouching to look at a little box on the ground, no bigger than a box for a ring, with nine sliding tiles on the top. “There’s some kind of puzzle here.”

“No, I see numbers, that counts as math,” Nellie protested. “We’re going to the next room.”

[[Tara&#39;s Puzzle - Devi&#39;s Tour]]

[[Library - Devi&#39;s Tour]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="480" name="Library - Devi&#39;s Tour" tags="" position="625,925" size="100,100">Devi walked through an ornate archway into a library that was exactly how her mother had described it to her. A part of her had always expected that memory, fear of trespassing where she did not belong when she tagged along after Tara into the more private quarters of the mansion, had colored her mother’s descriptions with darkness and dread. But the Bennington Mansion library was as cold and unwelcoming as her stories had always made it seem, made worse by the ravages of time and rot. 

“Is that sludge or a choice?” West asked at Devi’s shoulder.

She followed his camera up. The ceiling came to a point, painted all the same black or dark brown, and while it did look wet, fresh, it wasn’t dripping. It was the same style as the entry room ceiling, designed by Bradford, but if he wanted the entry hall to welcome people in with light, the smoky glass above them screamed at these visitors to leave or be swallowed by darkness. There weren’t any of the mansion’s signature porthole windows in this room, the only light dimly edging in from the hallway. Devi pulled a flashlight from her bag, frustrated that she had to use it so early in their exploration. 

“Probably could have used this earlier, but I wanted to save the battery,” said Devi, letting a beam of light disrupt the darkness.

Her light panned across the uninviting room, illuminating bookshelves still filled with books that would have been priceless if they weren’t so decrepit. The black leather sofas filled the room with a musky smell like animals that had come in from the damp. They sat low to the ground, like fungal growths, creating a kind of fairy path across the sprawling room. Devi could imagine walking through them and disappearing forever. 

Maybe this was the room where her mother had disappeared. 

“The floor is lava,” Nellie whispered.

Devi had not heard what inspired this statement, but West chuckled politely, and Devi offered a meek smile to pretend she had been paying attention. 

There was a blinding moment as the light caught on a large globe with a golden-hued frame and what looked like hand-painted countries, but Devi noticed with unease that they were not countries from any earth she recognized. It tilted at an odd, unearthly angle, and its elegance contrasted with the sensation of wrongness that it emanated. Devi’s eyes were transfixed for a moment, and she was not sure if she wanted to read the neat inky print naming each of those unfamiliar shapes cascading across the smooth surface or if she wanted give it a strong kick to send it smashing to the floor.
 
Devi stopped the light at the far end of the room, where a similar archway led further into the mansion, bringing them closer to their final destination. Next to it, a solid black winding staircase, its artificial smoothness making the sogging shelves behind it look even more forlorn, led to an upper floor. 

“Well,” said Nellie. “There’s a lot going on here. I feel like libraries are made to be haunted. Keep that camera on me, West.”

West did as he was told, but waited for Devi to take the lead.

Several times Bradford tried to cut him off, demanding that he make his own way in the world, but his more sympathetic family members always welcomed this prodigal son’s frequent returns. Police reported that one night his sisters both heard their father and brother yelling at each other, though whether they fought in Bradford’s bedroom or the kitchen was uncertain. This uncertainty would prove a boon to the elder Bradford, casting doubt on his daughters’ memories and therefore doubt on his possible involvement in his son’s disappearance. Bradford was screaming at Mark to leave their house for good, and the next morning Mark was gone. But not left, vanished. Immediate landscaping on the Bennington garden led to speculation that Bradford had killed him and buried him on the property. Some investigators claim they can hear sounds like muffled screams when they walk through the garden, pounding like it’s coming from beneath their feet. It’s been suggested he was buried alive.”

“Devi, I can’t take anymore,” said Nellie gagging. 

“Wait, does anyone see that guitar?” West asked.

The crew members looked at the misshapen piles of sludge around the room. Devi supposed any of those piles could have been a guitar at one point. Devi’s mother did tell her that Mark once screamed at Tara for touching his guitar. She wondered what he would have thought about the state of his beloved instrument now.

West frowned as he stared at piece of the bedframe that had not completely rotted.

“There’s some kind of message scratched on here,” West said, leaning down to read it more closely.

“West, do not touch the rotten wood,” Devi chided. “Let’s go.”

[[Mark&#39;s Message - Devi&#39;s Tour (Cont. from USR)]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="486" name="Tara&#39;s Room - Devi&#39;s Tour (from Dawn&#39;s/Mark&#39;s Room Cont. from USR)" tags="" position="725,800" size="100,100">“Holy crap, West, you’re recording this, right?”

“Yes, Nellie, obviously.”

The room was very dark. It was sandwiched between the hall and Dawn’s room, so there were no porthole windows to let in the scant starlight that lit the rest of the house. But even in the dull glow of the camera’s light, it was clear that this room had been spared the years of rot and disrepair they had seen elsewhere in the mansion. The bed even looked freshly made, turned down, ready for an occupant to slip inside. There was a teddy bear on a pillow. Edward. That was what Tara named him. She still slept with him well into her teen years. When Devi’s mother snuck into the Bennington parties, she always hoped Tara would find her, take her exploring through those mysterious hallways that only she could navigate, toting Edward along with her. Her mother made it sound like Tara conjured the halls out of thin air, but Devi assumed there were enough substances filling the air on those cool desert nights to make any trip on a back stairway seem like a miraculous journey to the stars. 

She was not sure what to make of her mother’s other stories, the ones where she and Tara hid behind cracked doors and watched as the Benningtons spoke to… something. Someone terrible, a man her mother never fully described. She never said what he did to Bradford, to his lovers, to Mark. She just said Dawn made sure to stay away from him, and Tara could never resist sneaking closer and closer until the day she was fully brought into the fold, leaving her mother on the other side of a firmly shut door. 

Her mother said the terrible creature was not a man. Not a ghost. Not a demon. Something else. Devi had been chasing him for years, a face to put to her mother’s memory. She did not know why she couldn’t dismiss the man in the same way she dismissed the magical hallways. 

“You should get in the bed,” West whispered to Nellie.

“I am not getting in the bed,” Nellie whispered back.

“Guys, please don’t whisper,” Devi sighed. “The mics won’t pick you up if you keep whispering.”

“Sorry, Devi,” said Nellie.

Devi flipped to Tara’s page in the guidebook. 

“This room belonged to Tara, Bradford’s youngest child. She moved into the house when she was thirteen, and though her mother tried to keep them separate, Bradford immediately inducted her into the world of dark arts. They would spend hours, sometimes days in his secret study, communing with dark forces. She was known to have fits of demonic possession during public get togethers, though her siblings insisted she performed these tricks because she was incredibly shy and it was an easy way to get back to her room or the library or to hide with her mother who also hated social events. After her siblings died and Bradford’s lovers abandoned him, Tara stayed, taking care of her father well into his old age. She was supposedly at his side when he died…”

Devi paused. The rest of the entry implied that Tara had killed him for her own dark purposes, to take revenge or gain power. It was a good story for a ghostly investigation. But she felt Edward’s button eyes on her, the same ones that watched her mother as the girls ran through magical hallways. She closed the book, smiling at West and Nellie like there was nothing else on the page. 

West and Nellie shared a shrug and turned to leave.

“Wait,” said Devi, crouching to look at a little box on the ground, no bigger than a box for a ring, with nine sliding tiles on the top. “There’s some kind of puzzle here.”

“No, I see numbers, that counts as math,” Nellie protested. “We’re going to the next room.”

[[Tara&#39;s Puzzle - Devi&#39;s Tour (Cont. from USR)]]

[[Library - Devi&#39;s Tour (Cont. from USR)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="487" name="Library - Devi&#39;s Tour (Cont. from USR)" tags="" position="625,925" size="100,100">Devi walked through an ornate archway into a library that was exactly how her mother had described it to her. A part of her had always expected that memory, fear of trespassing where she did not belong when she tagged along after Tara into the more private quarters of the mansion, had colored her mother’s descriptions with darkness and dread. But the Bennington Mansion library was as cold and unwelcoming as her stories had always made it seem, made worse by the ravages of time and rot. 

“Is that sludge or a choice?” West asked at Devi’s shoulder.

She followed his camera up. The ceiling came to a point, painted all the same black or dark brown, and while it did look wet, fresh, it wasn’t dripping. It was the same style as the entry room ceiling, designed by Bradford, but if he wanted the entry hall to welcome people in with light, the smoky glass above them screamed at these visitors to leave or be swallowed by darkness. There weren’t any of the mansion’s signature porthole windows in this room, the only light dimly edging in from the hallway. Devi pulled a flashlight from her bag, frustrated that she had to use it so early in their exploration. 

“Probably could have used this earlier, but I wanted to save the battery,” said Devi, letting a beam of light disrupt the darkness.

Her light panned across the uninviting room, illuminating bookshelves still filled with books that would have been priceless if they weren’t so decrepit. The black leather sofas filled the room with a musky smell like animals that had come in from the damp. They sat low to the ground, like fungal growths, creating a kind of fairy path across the sprawling room. Devi could imagine walking through them and disappearing forever. 

Maybe this was the room where her mother had disappeared. 

“The floor is lava,” Nellie whispered.

Devi had not heard what inspired this statement, but West chuckled politely, and Devi offered a meek smile to pretend she had been paying attention. 

There was a blinding moment as the light caught on a large globe with a golden-hued frame and what looked like hand-painted countries, but Devi noticed with unease that they were not countries from any earth she recognized. It tilted at an odd, unearthly angle, and its elegance contrasted with the sensation of wrongness that it emanated. Devi’s eyes were transfixed for a moment, and she was not sure if she wanted to read the neat inky print naming each of those unfamiliar shapes cascading across the smooth surface or if she wanted give it a strong kick to send it smashing to the floor.

Devi stopped the light at the far end of the room, where a similar archway led further into the mansion, bringing them closer to their final destination. Next to it, a solid black winding staircase, its artificial smoothness making the sogging shelves behind it look even more forlorn, led to an upper floor. 

“Well,” said Nellie. “There’s a lot going on here. I feel like libraries are made to be haunted. Keep that camera on me, West.”

West did as he was told, but waited for Devi to take the lead.

While West and Nellie had already wandered well into the room. West had paused his filming of the glass ceiling that must have continued above the house from the entry room while Nellie was playing with a telescope in the corner. But Devi could hear her mother’s voice in her head: “Guests were never allowed in observatory. It belonged to Bradford’s lovers. And they could not tolerate Bradford’s occult guests.”

Devi guessed that a crew of ghost hunters counted as occult guests of the house. She reminded herself that Tara would invade the privacy of the observatory all the time, even if she could never convince Devi’s mother to play along with her. Even years later, the little boxy black beds with their little boxy black side tables seemed so neat and perfect they defied anyone to mess with their perfect parallel angles. 

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West.

Devi shook off her unease and stepped inside, giving the beds and wide berth, accidentally bumping into Nellie who seemed equally distracted. 

“What does the guidebook say?” West prompted.

Devi opened the book but the words seemed to swim. They didn’t want to be read. She wasn’t supposed to be here. It was dangerous in the observatory. That was what her mother had said. That was why Bradford’s lovers told her to stay away. 

“You guys are… giving off bad vibes that I should definitely be filming,” said West.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="489" name="Globe - Devi&#39;s Tour" tags="" position="625,925" size="100,100">As West followed Nellie’s movements, Devi found herself forced closer to the decorative globe. She tried to pay attention to Nellie’s improvisation, tried to listen for any suspicious sounds picket up by the mics, but the globe kept drawing her attention. It was not even an approximation of real continents and oceans. It was beautiful though. The black ink shimmered under the glow of her flashlight and she reached out to press her hand against the smooth wood.

The slight pressure was met with a loud cracking sound as the globe split across its equator.

“Devi broke the globe!” Nellie laughed.

“No, she didn’t,” said West.

For a moment, Devi thought that West was just trying to make her feel better, but then she saw he was right. She had not broken the globe. It was meant to be opened, and disuse had just left the hinges loud and rusty. She opened the top of the globe further, revealing a collection of glass bottles inside half-filled with suspicious brown liquid.

“Scotch?” West asked.

“Devi, you should try it,” Nellie grinned. 

Devi was about to protest but was interrupted by West.

“Don’t tease her, Nellie,” he said. “Devi’s not as brave as us.”

Devi felt her cheeks burn. 

Before she could think about it enough to decide it was a terrible idea, Devi pulled out the crystal topper on one of the bottles and took three deep swigs of the mystery liquid inside. Which was, as West had suggested, scotch. The first two swigs tasted pretty good too, as smooth as any bourbon Devi had tried. She did not drink often, at all, but even she could tell this was high quality stuff. Still, the last swig left her coughing at a belated burn.

“Chug, chug, chug!” West chanted.

“I said try it, Devi, not drink the whole thing,” Nellie laughed.

The alcohol pooled warm in Devi’s stomach, and she smiled sheepishly under Nellie and West’s approval. She could already feel the hint of dizziness that warned she would be quite tipsy once the alcohol kicked into her system, but she decided that was a problem for future Devi. It was refreshing to be a little rebellious.

“No point of filming in a library if we don’t see books,” West agreed.

Nellie stepped over to the books, frowned as she examined the spines, and then her jaw dropped.

“Oh. My. God.”

“What is it?” asked Devi.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

West gave Devi a look that seemed to say, “you’re in charge, get our star to stop reading.” Devi sighed and walked up to Nellie, gently plucking the book from her hands, ignoring Nellie’s pout. But when Devi tried to put the book back into place, it no longer seemed to fit. She shined her flashlight at the space they had made and saw something tucked into the shelf, glinting in the light. Devi reached in and pulled out a locket.

“It’s beautiful,” Nellie whispered.

She reached out for it and Devi hopped deftly away.

“Absolutely not,” said Devi. “We’re putting it back. It probably belonged to one of the Benningtons and costs more than West’s camera.”

“It’s costume jewellery,” Nellie insisted, though her eyes looked hungry for the fake gold.

“Then… it probably was left by another ghost crew, or tourists, who might be looking for it,” Devi said, slipping the locket into her briefcase. “I’ll let the owner know that we found it tomorrow. It might have sentimental value.”

Nellie glared at Devi, but then she shrugged, wandering over to the sofas. 

“You should be filming me, West!” she shouted.

“You should put that in the hotel safe when we get back,” West whispered. “She’s totally going to try to steal it.”

Devi bit back her instinct to defend Nellie because West was most likely correct.

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? Devi shivered, but she still looked. Her mother said that the Bennington ladies loves astronomy, and for years Devi thought she meant astrology, it made more sense to her for the pseudo-sensationalists. But the women would draw star charts like they were oracles from some ancient civilization, the only ones marking the stories to the constellations. But however they observed the stars, Devi doubted it was through this telescope. 

“Something’s wrong with it,” Devi sighed. “I’m just seeing black. Moving on.”

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

“Looking to take a nap?” she asked.

“It looked weird,” said West, still squished the pillow. “Feels weird too.”

“It’s probably rotten,” shrugged Nellie.

“No,” said West. “There’s something…”

He shook the pillow and something small and square fell from its hiding place in the pillowcase. 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, triumphant.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box.

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

“Huh,” said West, picking out one of the chocolates. “They don’t look all that old.”

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

“And microplastics,” Devi added.

“Blegh,” said West, putting the chocolate back in its box. 

He placed the pillow on the bed, couldn’t fit the box back in the pillowcase, and decided to set the box at the foot of the bed.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

She thought that was what her mother had said. She had some memory that Bradford’s lover had been featured in fashion magazines and home magazines, something between style icons and domestic goddesses. But she couldn’t remember the names of the magazines, so she let her crew members ignore her as they argued. It gave her the freedom to pick up the small object that she had caught in the flashlight’s glow, hidden or fallen behind the side table. It was simple, delicate, a spiral journal with “TARA” printed in neat letters on the cover. Her diary.  

“Ooo, a diary, open it!” said Nellie.

Devi clutched the diary to her chest.

“No,” she said. “This is private. It’s inappropriate. We should return it to the owner.”

“A secret Bennington diary is good TV,” said West.

Devi shook her head.

Nellie sighed and laid a hand on Devi’s arm. She could barely feel the touch under her thick hoodie, but Devi flushed warm anyway. 

“At least hold onto it,” said Nellie. “You can look through it when we get back to the hotel and censor anything too sensitive. And if there is anything particularly compelling, we can scan the pages in the lobby. And then we can give the diary back tomorrow.”
Devi knew Nellie’s logic was off, but nodded anyway, slipping the diary into her briefcase. 

“Fine,” said Devi. “But there’s too much nice stuff in this library that I can’t trust either of you not to steal, and it’s too big for me to keep an eye on both of you. Let’s go to Bradford’s room.”

“You don’t think they’ll be nice stuff to steal there?” Nellie asked, all innocent big eyes.

“It’s one little room,” said Devi. “I can keep you both in check.”

Even after Tara abandoned her to the occult secrets that consumed her father, even after she snuck into the last party that almost killed her in the mysterious Bennington explosion, even after she had years of nightmares about the monster she had glimpsed… She had to come back one more time. One last time. Leaving her only daughter behind to mourn for her, to wonder how she had met her end in the Bennington Mansion. No, there was never a body found on the grounds. But the police never found Mark’s body, either. 

Devi’s eyes darted from the abandoned hospital bed, to the fraying pictures on the walls, to the intricately carved wardrobe at the far end of the room. One object boring and normal, some appropriately spooky, and one almost absurdly sinister. 

“Any guidebook info?” Mark asked.

“No,” Devi said. “Bradford was still living here during the heyday of the tours and this room was always private.”

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“I think there are some castle tours in Scotland like that,” said Devi.

“Haunted ones?” West asked, perking up. “We should do a trip. Claim it as a business expense.”

“Sure, West, I’ll bet the IRS will love that for us,” Nellie groaned.

“We’ll go to the garden next,” Devi said, nodding at the door on the far side of the room. “We have to cross it to get to the Gallery. And we might see the ghost of Bradford’s son, Mark. If Bradford killed him, amateur sleuths think that’s where he was probably buried. But no body was found so… probably not.”

She was surprised at how well she was able to keep her voice from trembling. 

“It could have been eaten by worms,” Nellie suggested.

“I don’t think worms work that fast,” West countered. “Unless they’re like, ‘Dune’ worms.”

Nellie wandered over to the pictures, touching them, messing with the frayed pieces and Devi wondered if it was worth the wasted energy to tell her to stop. 

“Does anyone see a knife?” asked Nellie.

West and Devi shook their heads. West was filming a engraved wardrobe in the corner. Devi sat on the edge of the hospital bed.

“That would have been too exciting, I guess,” Nellie sighed, letting the pieces of the picture fall back into disarray. “Does anyone see anything interesting?”

While West and Nellie had already wandered well into the room. West had paused his filming of the glass ceiling that must have continued above the house from the entry room while Nellie was playing with a telescope in the corner. But Devi could hear her mother’s voice in her head: “Guests were never allowed in observatory. It belonged to Bradford’s lovers. And they could not tolerate Bradford’s occult guests.”

Devi guessed that a crew of ghost hunters counted as occult guests of the house. She reminded herself that Tara would invade the privacy of the observatory all the time, even if she could never convince Devi’s mother to play along with her. Even years later, the little boxy black beds with their little boxy black side tables seemed so neat and perfect they defied anyone to mess with their perfect parallel angles. 

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West. “We probably have enough time to check out a couple things in here.”

Devi shook off her unease and stepped inside, giving the beds and wide berth, accidentally bumping into Nellie who seemed equally distracted. 

“What does the guidebook say?” West prompted.

Devi opened the book but the words seemed to swim. She didn’t think she had drunk that much. It couldn’t have been the Scotch. It had to have been the book. The words. They didn’t want to be read. She wasn’t supposed to be here. It was dangerous in the observatory. That was what her mother had said. That was why Bradford’s lovers told her to stay away. 

“You guys are… giving off bad vibes that I should definitely be filming,” said West.

Even after Tara abandoned her to the occult secrets that consumed her father, even after she snuck into the last party that almost killed her in the mysterious Bennington explosion, even after she had years of nightmares about the monster she had glimpsed… She had to come back one more time. One last time. Leaving her only daughter behind to mourn for her, to wonder how she had met her end in the Bennington Mansion. No, there was never a body found on the grounds. But the police never found Mark’s body, either. 

Devi’s eyes darted from the abandoned hospital bed, to the fraying pictures on the walls, to the intricately carved wardrobe at the far end of the room. One object boring and normal, some appropriately spooky, and one almost absurdly sinister. 

“Any guidebook info?” Mark asked.

“No,” Devi said. “Bradford was still living here during the heyday of the tours and this room was always private.”

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“I think there are some castle tours in Scotland like that,” said Devi.

“Haunted ones?” West asked, perking up. “We should do a trip. Claim it as a business expense.”

“Sure, West, I’ll bet the IRS will love that for us,” Nellie groaned.

“We’ll go to the garden next,” Devi said, nodding at the door on the far side of the room. “We have to cross it to get to the Gallery. And we might see the ghost of Bradford’s son, Mark. If Bradford killed him, amateur sleuths think that’s where he was probably buried. But no body was found so… probably not.”

She was surprised at how well she was able to keep her voice from trembling. 

“It could have been eaten by worms,” Nellie suggested.

“I don’t think worms work that fast,” West countered. “Unless they’re like, ‘Dune’ worms.”

Nellie wandered over to the pictures, touching them, messing with the frayed pieces and Devi wondered if it was worth the wasted energy to tell her to stop. 

“Does anyone see a knife?” asked Nellie.

West and Devi shook their heads. West was filming a engraved wardrobe in the corner. Devi sat on the edge of the hospital bed.

“That would have been too exciting, I guess,” Nellie sighed, letting the pieces of the picture fall back into disarray. “Does anyone see anything interesting?”

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? Devi shivered, but she still looked. Her mother said that the Bennington ladies loves astronomy, and for years Devi thought she meant astrology, it made more sense to her for the pseudo-sensationalists. But the women would draw star charts like they were oracles from some ancient civilization, the only ones marking the stories to the constellations. But however they observed the stars, Devi doubted it was through this telescope. 

“Something’s wrong with it,” Devi sighed. “I’m just seeing black. Moving on.”

“Did our little drunk-y forget to take off the lens cap?” West laughed.

“Don’t patronize me,” Devi said, throwing West a mock glare.

She made sure he didn’t see her slight of hand as she checked that there wasn’t a lens cap on the telescope, relieved when she felt solid glass.

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

“Looking to take a nap?” she asked.

“It looked weird,” said West, still squished the pillow. “Feels weird too.”

“It’s probably rotten,” shrugged Nellie.

“No,” said West. “There’s something…”

He shook the pillow and something small and square fell from its hiding place in the pillowcase. 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, triumphant.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box.

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

“Huh,” said West, picking out one of the chocolates. “They don’t look all that old.”

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

“And microplastics,” Devi added.

“Blegh,” said West, putting the chocolate back in its box. 

He placed the pillow on the bed, couldn’t fit the box back in the pillowcase, and decided to set the box at the foot of the bed.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

She thought that was what her mother had said. She had some memory that Bradford’s lover had been featured in fashion magazines and home magazines, something between style icons and domestic goddesses. But she couldn’t remember the names of the magazines, so she let her crew members ignore her as they argued. It gave her the freedom to pick up the small object that she had caught in the flashlight’s glow, hidden or fallen behind the side table. It was simple, delicate, a spiral journal with “TARA” printed in neat letters on the cover. Her diary.  

“Ooo, a diary, open it!” said Nellie.

Devi clutched the diary to her chest.

“No,” she said. “This is private. It’s inappropriate. We should return it to the owner.”

“A secret Bennington diary is good TV,” said West.

Devi shook her head.

Nellie sighed and laid a hand on Devi’s arm. She could barely feel the touch under her thick hoodie, but Devi flushed warm anyway. 

“At least hold onto it,” said Nellie. “You can look through it when we get back to the hotel and censor anything too sensitive. And if there is anything particularly compelling, we can scan the pages in the lobby. And then we can give the diary back tomorrow.”

Devi knew Nellie’s logic was off, but her head was getting fuzzy from the alcohol, so she just nodded and slipped the diary into her briefcase.

“Fine,” said Devi. “But there’s too much nice stuff in this library that I can’t trust either of you not to steal, and it’s too big for me to keep an eye on both of you. Let’s go to Bradford’s room.”

“You don’t think they’ll be nice stuff to steal there?” Nellie asked, all innocent big eyes.

“It’s one little room,” said Devi. “I can keep you both in check.”

“What is it?” asked Devi.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

West gave Devi a look that seemed to say, “you’re in charge, get our star to stop reading.” Devi sighed and walked up to Nellie, gently plucking the book from her hands, ignoring Nellie’s pout. But when Devi tried to put the book back into place, it no longer seemed to fit. She shined her flashlight at the space they had made and saw something tucked into the shelf, glinting in the light. Devi reached in and pulled out a locket.

“It’s beautiful,” Nellie whispered.

She reached out for it and Devi hopped deftly away.

“Absolutely not,” said Devi. “We’re putting it back. It probably belonged to one of the Benningtons and costs more than West’s camera.”

“It’s costume jewellery,” Nellie insisted, though her eyes looked hungry for the fake gold.

“Then… it probably was left by another ghost crew, or tourists, who might be looking for it,” Devi said, slipping the locket into her briefcase. “I’ll let the owner know that we found it tomorrow. It might have sentimental value.”

“Fine,” said Devi. “But there’s too much nice stuff in this library that I can’t trust either of you not to steal, and it’s too big for me to keep an eye on both of you. Let’s go to Bradford’s room.”

“You don’t think they’ll be nice stuff to steal there?” Nellie asked, all innocent big eyes.

“It’s one little room,” said Devi. “I can keep you both in check.”

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? Devi shivered, but she still looked. Her mother said that the Bennington ladies loves astronomy, and for years Devi thought she meant astrology, it made more sense to her for the pseudo-sensationalists. But the women would draw star charts like they were oracles from some ancient civilization, the only ones marking the stories to the constellations. But however they observed the stars, Devi doubted it was through this telescope. 

“Something’s wrong with it,” Devi sighed. “I’m just seeing black. Moving on.”

“Did our little drunk-y forget to take off the lens cap?” West laughed.

“Don’t patronize me,” Devi said, throwing West a mock glare. &quot;Let&#39;s get back to the library.&quot;

She made sure he didn’t see her slight of hand as she checked that there wasn’t a lens cap on the telescope, relieved when she felt solid glass.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="516" name="Globe - Devi&#39;s Tour (with Locket)" tags="" position="625,925" size="100,100">As West followed Nellie’s movements, Devi found herself forced closer to the decorative globe. She tried to pay attention to Nellie’s improvisation, tried to listen for any suspicious sounds picket up by the mics, but the globe kept drawing her attention. It was not even an approximation of real continents and oceans. It was beautiful though. The black ink shimmered under the glow of her flashlight and she reached out to press her hand against the smooth wood.

The slight pressure was met with a loud cracking sound as the globe split across its equator.

“Devi broke the globe!” Nellie laughed.

“No, she didn’t,” said West.

For a moment, Devi thought that West was just trying to make her feel better, but then she saw he was right. She had not broken the globe. It was meant to be opened, and disuse had just left the hinges loud and rusty. She opened the top of the globe further, revealing a collection of glass bottles inside half-filled with suspicious brown liquid.

“Scotch?” West asked.

“Devi, you should try it,” Nellie grinned. 

Devi was about to protest but was interrupted by West.

“Don’t tease her, Nellie,” he said. “Devi’s not as brave as us.”

Devi felt her cheeks burn. 

Before she could think about it enough to decide it was a terrible idea, Devi pulled out the crystal topper on one of the bottles and took three deep swigs of the mystery liquid inside. Which was, as West had suggested, scotch. The first two swigs tasted pretty good too, as smooth as any bourbon Devi had tried. She did not drink often, at all, but even she could tell this was high quality stuff. Still, the last swig left her coughing at a belated burn.

“Chug, chug, chug!” West chanted.

“I said try it, Devi, not drink the whole thing,” Nellie laughed.

The alcohol pooled warm in Devi’s stomach, and she smiled sheepishly under Nellie and West’s approval. She could already feel the hint of dizziness that warned she would be quite tipsy once the alcohol kicked into her system, but she decided that was a problem for future Devi. It was refreshing to be a little rebellious.

While West and Nellie had already wandered well into the room. West had paused his filming of the glass ceiling that must have continued above the house from the entry room while Nellie was playing with a telescope in the corner. But Devi could hear her mother’s voice in her head: “Guests were never allowed in observatory. It belonged to Bradford’s lovers. And they could not tolerate Bradford’s occult guests.”

Devi guessed that a crew of ghost hunters counted as occult guests of the house. She reminded herself that Tara would invade the privacy of the observatory all the time, even if she could never convince Devi’s mother to play along with her. Even years later, the little boxy black beds with their little boxy black side tables seemed so neat and perfect they defied anyone to mess with their perfect parallel angles. 

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West. “We probably have enough time to check out a couple things in here.”

Devi shook off her unease and stepped inside, giving the beds and wide berth, accidentally bumping into Nellie who seemed equally distracted. 

“What does the guidebook say?” West prompted.

Devi opened the book but the words seemed to swim. They didn’t want to be read. She wasn’t supposed to be here. It was dangerous in the observatory. That was what her mother had said. That was why Bradford’s lovers told her to stay away. 

“You guys are… giving off bad vibes that I should definitely be filming,” said West.

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

“Looking to take a nap?” she asked.

“It looked weird,” said West, still squished the pillow. “Feels weird too.”

“It’s probably rotten,” shrugged Nellie.

“No,” said West. “There’s something…”

He shook the pillow and something small and square fell from its hiding place in the pillowcase. 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, triumphant.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box.

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

“Huh,” said West, picking out one of the chocolates. “They don’t look all that old.”

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

“And microplastics,” Devi added.

“Blegh,” said West, putting the chocolate back in its box. 

He placed the pillow on the bed, couldn’t fit the box back in the pillowcase, and decided to set the box at the foot of the bed.

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

She thought that was what her mother had said. She had some memory that Bradford’s lover had been featured in fashion magazines and home magazines, something between style icons and domestic goddesses. But she couldn’t remember the names of the magazines, so she let her crew members ignore her as they argued. It gave her the freedom to pick up the small object that she had caught in the flashlight’s glow, hidden or fallen behind the side table. It was simple, delicate, a spiral journal with “TARA” printed in neat letters on the cover. Her diary.  

“Ooo, a diary, open it!” said Nellie.

Devi clutched the diary to her chest.

“No,” she said. “This is private. It’s inappropriate. We should return it to the owner.”

“A secret Bennington diary is good TV,” said West.

Devi shook her head.

Nellie sighed and laid a hand on Devi’s arm. She could barely feel the touch under her thick hoodie, but Devi flushed warm anyway.

“No point of filming in a library if we don’t see books,” West agreed.

Nellie stepped over to the books, frowned as she examined the spines, and then her jaw dropped.

“Oh. My. God.”

“What is it?” asked Devi.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

West gave Devi a look that seemed to say, “you’re in charge, get our star to stop reading.” Devi sighed and walked up to Nellie, gently plucking the book from her hands, ignoring Nellie’s pout. But when Devi tried to put the book back into place, it no longer seemed to fit. She shined her flashlight at the space they had made and saw something tucked into the shelf, glinting in the light. Devi reached in and pulled out a locket.

“It’s beautiful,” Nellie whispered.

She reached out for it and Devi hopped deftly away.

“Absolutely not,” said Devi. “We’re putting it back. It probably belonged to one of the Benningtons and costs more than West’s camera.”

“It’s costume jewellery,” Nellie insisted, though her eyes looked hungry for the fake gold.

“Then… it probably was left by another ghost crew, or tourists, who might be looking for it,” Devi said, slipping the locket into her briefcase. “I’ll let the owner know that we found it tomorrow. It might have sentimental value.”

Nellie glared at Devi, but then she shrugged, wandering over to the sofas. 

“You should be filming me, West!” she shouted.

“You should put that in the hotel safe when we get back,” West whispered. “She’s totally going to try to steal it.”

Devi bit back her instinct to defend Nellie because West was most likely correct.

It was simple, delicate, a spiral journal with “TARA” printed in neat letters on the cover. Her diary.  

“Ooo, a diary, open it!” said Nellie.

Devi clutched the diary to her chest.

“No,” she said. “This is private. It’s inappropriate. We should return it to the owner.”

“A secret Bennington diary is good TV,” said West.

Devi shook her head.

Nellie sighed and laid a hand on Devi’s arm. She could barely feel the touch under her thick hoodie, but Devi flushed warm anyway. 

“At least hold onto it,” said Nellie. “You can look through it when we get back to the hotel and censor anything too sensitive. And if there is anything particularly compelling, we can scan the pages in the lobby. And then we can give the diary back tomorrow.”
Devi knew Nellie’s logic was off, but nodded anyway, slipping the diary into her briefcase. 

“Fine,” said Devi. “But there’s too much nice stuff in this library that I can’t trust either of you not to steal, and it’s too big for me to keep an eye on both of you. Let’s go to Bradford’s room.”

“You don’t think they’ll be nice stuff to steal there?” Nellie asked, all innocent big eyes.

“It’s one little room,” said Devi. “I can keep you both in check.”

Even after Tara abandoned her to the occult secrets that consumed her father, even after she snuck into the last party that almost killed her in the mysterious Bennington explosion, even after she had years of nightmares about the monster she had glimpsed… She had to come back one more time. One last time. Leaving her only daughter behind to mourn for her, to wonder how she had met her end in the Bennington Mansion. No, there was never a body found on the grounds. But the police never found Mark’s body, either. 

Devi’s eyes darted from the abandoned hospital bed, to the fraying pictures on the walls, to the intricately carved wardrobe at the far end of the room. One object boring and normal, some appropriately spooky, and one almost absurdly sinister. 

“Any guidebook info?” Mark asked.

“No,” Devi said. “Bradford was still living here during the heyday of the tours and this room was always private.”

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“I think there are some castle tours in Scotland like that,” said Devi.

“Haunted ones?” West asked, perking up. “We should do a trip. Claim it as a business expense.”

“Sure, West, I’ll bet the IRS will love that for us,” Nellie groaned.

“We’ll go to the garden next,” Devi said, nodding at the door on the far side of the room. “We have to cross it to get to the Gallery. And we might see the ghost of Bradford’s son, Mark. If Bradford killed him, amateur sleuths think that’s where he was probably buried. But no body was found so… probably not.”

She was surprised at how well she was able to keep her voice from trembling. 

“It could have been eaten by worms,” Nellie suggested.

“I don’t think worms work that fast,” West countered. “Unless they’re like, ‘Dune’ worms.”

Nellie wandered over to the pictures, touching them, messing with the frayed pieces and Devi wondered if it was worth the wasted energy to tell her to stop. 

“Does anyone see a knife?” asked Nellie.

West and Devi shook their heads. West was filming a engraved wardrobe in the corner. Devi sat on the edge of the hospital bed.

“That would have been too exciting, I guess,” Nellie sighed, letting the pieces of the picture fall back into disarray. “Does anyone see anything interesting?”

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

“Looking to take a nap?” she asked.

“It looked weird,” said West, still squished the pillow. “Feels weird too.”

“It’s probably rotten,” shrugged Nellie.

“No,” said West. “There’s something…”

He shook the pillow and something small and square fell from its hiding place in the pillowcase. 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, triumphant.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box.

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

“Huh,” said West, picking out one of the chocolates. “They don’t look all that old.”

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

“Blegh,” said West, putting the chocolate back in its box. 

Devi thought of the footsteps she heard earlier and had an unsettling moment… No. That was ridiculous. This wasn’t an Oscar-winning South Korean film. There was no one hiding out of sight, eating hidden stashes of chocolate.

He placed the pillow on the bed, couldn’t fit the box back in the pillowcase, and decided to set the box at the foot of the bed.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

She thought that was what her mother had said. She had some memory that Bradford’s lover had been featured in fashion magazines and home magazines, something between style icons and domestic goddesses. But she couldn’t remember the names of the magazines, so she let her crew members ignore her as they argued.

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? Devi shivered, but she still looked. Her mother said that the Bennington ladies loves astronomy, and for years Devi thought she meant astrology, it made more sense to her for the pseudo-sensationalists. But the women would draw star charts like they were oracles from some ancient civilization, the only ones marking the stories to the constellations. But however they observed the stars, Devi doubted it was through this telescope. 

“Something’s wrong with it,” Devi sighed. “I’m just seeing black. Moving on.”

[[Side Table - Devi&#39;s Tour (from Telescope Cont. from USR)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="537" name="Globe - Devi&#39;s Tour (with Locket Cont. from USR)" tags="" position="625,925" size="100,100">As West followed Nellie’s movements, Devi found herself forced closer to the decorative globe. She tried to pay attention to Nellie’s improvisation, tried to listen for any suspicious sounds picket up by the mics, but the globe kept drawing her attention. It was not even an approximation of real continents and oceans. It was beautiful though. The black ink shimmered under the glow of her flashlight and she reached out to press her hand against the smooth wood.

The slight pressure was met with a loud cracking sound as the globe split across its equator.

“Devi broke the globe!” Nellie laughed.

“No, she didn’t,” said West.

For a moment, Devi thought that West was just trying to make her feel better, but then she saw he was right. She had not broken the globe. It was meant to be opened, and disuse had just left the hinges loud and rusty. She opened the top of the globe further, revealing a collection of glass bottles inside half-filled with suspicious brown liquid.

“Scotch?” West asked.

“Devi, you should try it,” Nellie grinned. 

Devi was about to protest but was interrupted by West.

“Don’t tease her, Nellie,” he said. “Devi’s not as brave as us.”

Devi felt her cheeks burn. 

Before she could think about it enough to decide it was a terrible idea, Devi pulled out the crystal topper on one of the bottles and took three deep swigs of the mystery liquid inside. Which was, as West had suggested, scotch. The first two swigs tasted pretty good too, as smooth as any bourbon Devi had tried. She did not drink often, at all, but even she could tell this was high quality stuff. Still, the last swig left her coughing at a belated burn.

“Chug, chug, chug!” West chanted.

“I said try it, Devi, not drink the whole thing,” Nellie laughed.

The alcohol pooled warm in Devi’s stomach, and she smiled sheepishly under Nellie and West’s approval. She could already feel the hint of dizziness that warned she would be quite tipsy once the alcohol kicked into her system, but she decided that was a problem for future Devi. It was refreshing to be a little rebellious.

While West and Nellie had already wandered well into the room. West had paused his filming of the glass ceiling that must have continued above the house from the entry room while Nellie was playing with a telescope in the corner. But Devi could hear her mother’s voice in her head: “Guests were never allowed in observatory. It belonged to Bradford’s lovers. And they could not tolerate Bradford’s occult guests.”

Devi guessed that a crew of ghost hunters counted as occult guests of the house. She reminded herself that Tara would invade the privacy of the observatory all the time, even if she could never convince Devi’s mother to play along with her. Even years later, the little boxy black beds with their little boxy black side tables seemed so neat and perfect they defied anyone to mess with their perfect parallel angles. 

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West. “We probably have enough time to check out a couple things in here.”

Devi shook off her unease and stepped inside, giving the beds and wide berth, accidentally bumping into Nellie who seemed equally distracted. 

“What does the guidebook say?” West prompted.

Devi opened the book but the words seemed to swim. They didn’t want to be read. She wasn’t supposed to be here. It was dangerous in the observatory. That was what her mother had said. That was why Bradford’s lovers told her to stay away. 

“You guys are… giving off bad vibes that I should definitely be filming,” said West.

She made sure he didn’t see her slight of hand as she checked that there wasn’t a lens cap on the telescope, relieved when she felt solid glass.

“Fine,” said Devi. “But there’s too much nice stuff in this library that I can’t trust either of you not to steal, and it’s too big for me to keep an eye on both of you. Let’s go to Bradford’s room.”

“You don’t think they’ll be nice stuff to steal there?” Nellie asked, all innocent big eyes.

“It’s one little room,” said Devi. “I can keep you both in check.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

She thought that was what her mother had said. She had some memory that Bradford’s lover had been featured in fashion magazines and home magazines, something between style icons and domestic goddesses. But she couldn’t remember the names of the magazines, so she let her crew members ignore her as they argued. It gave her the freedom to pick up the small object that she had caught in the flashlight’s glow, hidden or fallen behind the side table. It was simple, delicate, a spiral journal with “TARA” printed in neat letters on the cover. Her diary.  

“Ooo, a diary, open it!” said Nellie.

Devi clutched the diary to her chest.

“No,” she said. “This is private. It’s inappropriate. We should return it to the owner.”

“A secret Bennington diary is good TV,” said West.

Devi shook her head.

Nellie sighed and laid a hand on Devi’s arm. She could barely feel the touch under her thick hoodie, but Devi flushed warm anyway. 

“At least hold onto it,” said Nellie. “You can look through it when we get back to the hotel and censor anything too sensitive. And if there is anything particularly compelling, we can scan the pages in the lobby. And then we can give the diary back tomorrow.”

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? Devi shivered, but she still looked. Her mother said that the Bennington ladies loves astronomy, and for years Devi thought she meant astrology, it made more sense to her for the pseudo-sensationalists. But the women would draw star charts like they were oracles from some ancient civilization, the only ones marking the stories to the constellations. But however they observed the stars, Devi doubted it was through this telescope. 

“Something’s wrong with it,” Devi sighed. “I’m just seeing black. Moving on.”

[[Globe - Devi&#39;s Tour (with Locket Cont. from USR and Upper Observatory)]]

[[Bradford&#39;s Bedroom - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR with Locket)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="549" name="Globe - Devi&#39;s Tour (with Locket Cont. from USR and Upper Observatory)" tags="" position="625,925" size="100,100">As West followed Nellie’s movements, Devi found herself forced closer to the decorative globe. She tried to pay attention to Nellie’s improvisation, tried to listen for any suspicious sounds picket up by the mics, but the globe kept drawing her attention. It was not even an approximation of real continents and oceans. It was beautiful though. The black ink shimmered under the glow of her flashlight and she reached out to press her hand against the smooth wood.

The slight pressure was met with a loud cracking sound as the globe split across its equator.

“Devi broke the globe!” Nellie laughed.

“No, she didn’t,” said West.

For a moment, Devi thought that West was just trying to make her feel better, but then she saw he was right. She had not broken the globe. It was meant to be opened, and disuse had just left the hinges loud and rusty. She opened the top of the globe further, revealing a collection of glass bottles inside half-filled with suspicious brown liquid.

“Scotch?” West asked.

“Devi, you should try it,” Nellie grinned. 

Devi was about to protest but was interrupted by West.

“Don’t tease her, Nellie,” he said. “Devi’s not as brave as us.”

Devi felt her cheeks burn. 

Before she could think about it enough to decide it was a terrible idea, Devi pulled out the crystal topper on one of the bottles and took three deep swigs of the mystery liquid inside. Which was, as West had suggested, scotch. The first two swigs tasted pretty good too, as smooth as any bourbon Devi had tried. She did not drink often, at all, but even she could tell this was high quality stuff. Still, the last swig left her coughing at a belated burn.

“Chug, chug, chug!” West chanted.

“I said try it, Devi, not drink the whole thing,” Nellie laughed.

The alcohol pooled warm in Devi’s stomach, and she smiled sheepishly under Nellie and West’s approval. She could already feel the hint of dizziness that warned she would be quite tipsy once the alcohol kicked into her system, but she decided that was a problem for future Devi. It was refreshing to be a little rebellious. 

[[Bradford&#39;s Bedroom - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR Tipsy with Locket)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="550" name="Bradford&#39;s Bedroom - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR with Locket)" tags="" position="625,1050" size="100,100">Devi tried to act like she was completely fine, like this wasn’t the room of the man who built the house her mother just couldn’t resist returning to. Even after Tara abandoned her to the occult secrets that consumed her father, even after she snuck into the last party that almost killed her in the mysterious Bennington explosion, even after she had years of nightmares about the monster she had glimpsed… She had to come back one more time. One last time. Leaving her only daughter behind to mourn for her, to wonder how she had met her end in the Bennington Mansion. No, there was never a body found on the grounds. But the police never found Mark’s body, either. 

Devi’s eyes darted from the abandoned hospital bed, to the fraying pictures on the walls, to the intricately carved wardrobe at the far end of the room. One object boring and normal, some appropriately spooky, and one almost absurdly sinister. 

“Any guidebook info?” Mark asked.

“No,” Devi said. “Bradford was still living here during the heyday of the tours and this room was always private.”

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“I think there are some castle tours in Scotland like that,” said Devi.

“Haunted ones?” West asked, perking up. “We should do a trip. Claim it as a business expense.”

“Sure, West, I’ll bet the IRS will love that for us,” Nellie groaned.

“We’ll go to the garden next,” Devi said, nodding at the door on the far side of the room. “We have to cross it to get to the Gallery. And we might see the ghost of Bradford’s son, Mark. If Bradford killed him, amateur sleuths think that’s where he was probably buried. But no body was found so… probably not.”

She was surprised at how well she was able to keep her voice from trembling. 

“It could have been eaten by worms,” Nellie suggested.

“I don’t think worms work that fast,” West countered. “Unless they’re like, ‘Dune’ worms.”

Nellie wandered over to the pictures, touching them, messing with the frayed pieces and Devi wondered if it was worth the wasted energy to tell her to stop. 

“Does anyone see a knife?” asked Nellie.

West and Devi shook their heads. West was filming a engraved wardrobe in the corner. Devi sat on the edge of the hospital bed.

“That would have been too exciting, I guess,” Nellie sighed, letting the pieces of the picture fall back into disarray. “Does anyone see anything interesting?”

But the police never found Mark’s body, either. 

Devi felt nauseous. The Scotch had settled like a hot lump of iron in her stomach. She knew she was a lightweight, but she had never gotten this sick this quickly after drinking. It was stronger stuff than she was used to, and she had quite a bit. She set a hand against the doorframe for balance, wondering if her crew members noticed, if they suspected that for their sound engineer the sparsely decorated room was spinning.

Devi’s eyes darted from the abandoned hospital bed, to the fraying pictures on the walls, to the intricately carved wardrobe at the far end of the room. One object boring and normal, some appropriately spooky, and one almost absurdly sinister. 

“Any guidebook info?” Mark asked.

“No,” Devi said. “Bradford was still living here during the heyday of the tours and this room was always private.”

She was glad she did not need to try to read. If the room was spinning, she couldn’t imagine what letters would look like.

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“I think there are some castle tours in Scotland like that,” said Devi.

West and Devi shook their heads. West was filming a engraved wardrobe in the corner. Devi sat on the edge of the hospital bed, hoping the room might go still if she got off her feet, but the change did little to settle her roiling stomach.

“That would have been too exciting, I guess,” Nellie sighed, letting the pieces of the picture fall back into disarray. “Does anyone see anything interesting?”

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

“Looking to take a nap?” she asked.

“It looked weird,” said West, still squished the pillow. “Feels weird too.”

“It’s probably rotten,” shrugged Nellie.

“No,” said West. “There’s something…”

He shook the pillow and something small and square fell from its hiding place in the pillowcase. 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, triumphant.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box.

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

“Huh,” said West, picking out one of the chocolates. “They don’t look all that old.”

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

“Blegh,” said West, putting the chocolate back in its box. 

Devi thought of the footsteps she heard earlier and had an unsettling moment… No. That was ridiculous. This wasn’t an Oscar-winning South Korean film. There was no one hiding out of sight, eating hidden stashes of chocolate.

He placed the pillow on the bed, couldn’t fit the box back in the pillowcase, and decided to set the box at the foot of the bed.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

“No point of filming in a library if we don’t see books,” West agreed.

Nellie stepped over to the books, frowned as she examined the spines, and then her jaw dropped.

“Oh. My. God.”

“What is it?” asked Devi.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

West gave Devi a look that seemed to say, “you’re in charge, get our star to stop reading.” Devi sighed and walked up to Nellie, gently plucking the book from her hands, ignoring Nellie’s pout. But when Devi tried to put the book back into place, it no longer seemed to fit. She shined her flashlight at the space they had made and saw something tucked into the shelf, glinting in the light. Devi reached in and pulled out a locket.

“It’s beautiful,” Nellie whispered.

She reached out for it and Devi hopped deftly away.

“Absolutely not,” said Devi. “We’re putting it back. It probably belonged to one of the Benningtons and costs more than West’s camera.”

“It’s costume jewellery,” Nellie insisted, though her eyes looked hungry for the fake gold.

“Then… it probably was left by another ghost crew, or tourists, who might be looking for it,” Devi said, slipping the locket into her briefcase. “I’ll let the owner know that we found it tomorrow. It might have sentimental value.”

Nellie glared at Devi, but then she shrugged, wandering over to the sofas. 

“You should be filming me, West!” she shouted.

“You should put that in the hotel safe when we get back,” West whispered. “She’s totally going to try to steal it.”

Devi bit back her instinct to defend Nellie because West was most likely correct.

While West and Nellie had already wandered well into the room. West had paused his filming of the glass ceiling that must have continued above the house from the entry room while Nellie was playing with a telescope in the corner. But Devi could hear her mother’s voice in her head: “Guests were never allowed in observatory. It belonged to Bradford’s lovers. And they could not tolerate Bradford’s occult guests.”

Devi guessed that a crew of ghost hunters counted as occult guests of the house. She reminded herself that Tara would invade the privacy of the observatory all the time, even if she could never convince Devi’s mother to play along with her. Even years later, the little boxy black beds with their little boxy black side tables seemed so neat and perfect they defied anyone to mess with their perfect parallel angles. 

“I mean, I’m happy to just shoot footage of this sky, but should we look around a bit?” asked West. “We probably have enough time to check out a couple of the things in here.”

Devi shook off her unease and stepped inside, giving the beds and wide berth, accidentally bumping into Nellie who seemed equally distracted. 

“What does the guidebook say?” West prompted.

Devi opened the book but the words seemed to swim. She didn’t think she had drunk that much. It couldn’t have been the Scotch. It had to have been the book. The words. They didn’t want to be read. She wasn’t supposed to be here. It was dangerous in the observatory. That was what her mother had said. That was why Bradford’s lovers told her to stay away. 

“You guys are… giving off bad vibes that I should definitely be filming,” said West.

“Did our little drunk-y forget to take off the lens cap?” West laughed.

“Don’t patronize me,” Devi said, throwing West a mock glare.

She made sure he didn’t see her slight of hand as she checked that there wasn’t a lens cap on the telescope, relieved when she felt solid glass.

“Then… it probably was left by another ghost crew, or tourists, who might be looking for it,” Devi said, slipping the locket into her briefcase. “I’ll let the owner know that we found it tomorrow. It might have sentimental value.”

Nellie glared at Devi, but then she shrugged, wandering over to the sofas. 

“You should be filming me, West!” she shouted.

“You should put that in the hotel safe when we get back,” West whispered. “She’s totally going to try to steal it.”

Devi bit back her instinct to defend Nellie because West was most likely correct.

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

She thought that was what her mother had said. She had some memory that Bradford’s lover had been featured in fashion magazines and home magazines, something between style icons and domestic goddesses. But she couldn’t remember the names of the magazines, so she let her crew members ignore her as they argued. It gave her the freedom to pick up the small object that she had caught in the flashlight’s glow, hidden or fallen behind the side table. It was simple, delicate, a spiral journal with “TARA” printed in neat letters on the cover. Her diary.  

“Ooo, a diary, open it!” said Nellie.

Devi clutched the diary to her chest.

“No,” she said. “This is private. It’s inappropriate. We should return it to the owner.”

“A secret Bennington diary is good TV,” said West.

Devi shook her head.

Nellie sighed and laid a hand on Devi’s arm. She could barely feel the touch under her thick hoodie, but Devi flushed warm anyway. 

“At least hold onto it,” said Nellie. “You can look through it when we get back to the hotel and censor anything too sensitive. And if there is anything particularly compelling, we can scan the pages in the lobby. And then we can give the diary back tomorrow.”

Devi knew Nellie’s logic was off, but her head was getting fuzzy from the alcohol, so she just nodded and slipped the diary into her briefcase.

“Fine,” said Devi. “But there’s too much nice stuff in this library that I can’t trust either of you not to steal, and it’s too big for me to keep an eye on both of you. Let’s go to Bradford’s room.”

“You don’t think they’ll be nice stuff to steal there?” Nellie asked, all innocent big eyes.

“It’s one little room,” said Devi. “I can keep you both in check.”

[[Bradford&#39;s Bedroom - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR Tipsy with Diary)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="563" name="Telescope - Devi&#39;s Tour (Cont. from USR and Globe and Observatory Bed)" tags="" position="625,925" size="100,100">Nellie looked through the telescope that pointed high at the clear glass ceiling and frowned, pulling back suddenly. 

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? Devi shivered, but she still looked. Her mother said that the Bennington ladies loves astronomy, and for years Devi thought she meant astrology, it made more sense to her for the pseudo-sensationalists. But the women would draw star charts like they were oracles from some ancient civilization, the only ones marking the stories to the constellations. But however they observed the stars, Devi doubted it was through this telescope. 

“Something’s wrong with it,” Devi sighed. “I’m just seeing black. Moving on.”

“Did our little drunk-y forget to take off the lens cap?” West laughed.

“Don’t patronize me,” Devi said, throwing West a mock glare.

She made sure he didn’t see her slight of hand as she checked that there wasn’t a lens cap on the telescope, relieved when she felt solid glass.

Devi lifted it, finding a small, crumpled piece of paper covered in neat handwriting. 

“There’s a letter on this bed,” she said.

“That is… shockingly convenient,” said West. 

“Maybe it’s a prop for ghost tours like us,” Nellie said. 

Devi tried to read the letter, but time had done some damage to its legibility. 

“It’s old, I think,” said Devi. “Some of the ink has bled, but it looks like a letter from Bradford to his daughter, Tara. He’s apologizing for… something. ‘You have responsibilities no one should have to bear, and I’m sorry I doomed you to this lonely existence.’ That’s sad, it’s not his fault he got sick.”

“Tell that to the doctors’ warnings on cigar boxes,” Nellie snorted.

“Here, Nellie, you keep reading,” said Devi, shoving the letter into her hands.

“Careful with that!” Nellie said. “West, film me. He apologizes to Tara, tells her she has responsibilities, and says… this is hard to make out, it’s so dark in here… He says Mark was a threat to the family, he did what he had to do…”

“Is he confessing to killing him?” asked West.

“He might just be confessing to kicking him out,” Nellie said, shaking her head. “There aren’t any specifics. Okay, then he says his daughter Dawn never understood, she was a danger… she was in danger? Well, there’s a paragraph about Dawn and danger and… Emma?”

“Emma was Dawn’s girlfriend,” Devi said, then shook her head. “Well, her tragically dead girlfriend.”

“The writing isn’t clear there,” said Nellie. “He says he’s trapped, he just wants to be free, maybe it’s a final gift he can give Tara… ugh. Oh no.”

“What?” asked Devi.

“He’s asking her to sacrifice him. For her own freedom.”

The three crewmembers were silent for a moment.

“But we don’t know if she killed him,” said West.

“We should hold on to that letter!” Devi said, too loudly, and West and Nellie stared blankly at her. “I mean… it could be useful. For the show. And I’m in charge. So.”

She grabbed the letter, sticking it into her bag. Maybe Tara wasn’t exactly responsible for her mother’s disappearance. But if she was responsible for Bradford’s death, maybe this letter could be used to make her pay. As much as any dead or missing woman could pay for anything.

“What is that?” Nellie gasped.

The wardrobe appeared to be a door, not a wardrobe, leading down into the ground, into darkness.

“It is a creepy secret passageway,” West declared. “What do you say, Devi? Should we go down?”

“We are not going down into the scary secret passageway in the demonic occult building,” said Devi. “Besides, it’s too dark for us to really see what’s down there, anyway. My flashlight’s batteries are dead.”

She was surprised that neither of her crew members questioned her statement, beyond looking mildly disappointed. She doubted the batteries were dead, but it was as good an excuse as any to avoid that looming darkness. Unfortunately, it meant that she would now have to commit to the lie, and the night was only going to get darker. 

“Well, what else are we going to show our viewers?” asked West, grinning at Devi, but his good cheer felt like more like a challenge than a joke.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="566" name="Gallery - Devi&#39;s Tour (with Diary)" tags="" position="625,1175" size="100,100">The cacti of the garden loomed like gargoyles, filling up as much space as they could beside the circling stone path. Devi thought the flowers that bloomed from them, ranging from pale pink to red, were lovely, if perhaps a little too “fleshy” to be called beautiful. Maybe it was because the cacti themselves were as tall as people, Devi found herself imagining the loose petals as flopping tongues. Her mother had never mentioned the garden. Perhaps she never made it this far into the house. The thought made Devi want to turn around, but she could not leave Nellie and West alone to wreak havoc. Even if the encircling high fence that enclosed the garden kept their havoc contained. 

“Hold that position,” West said to Nellie, who was gently caressing a petal.

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” said Devi.

“Oh shit,” said Nellie, hopping off the gravel to the dirt that surrounded it. “Did we mess up some kind of art piece? Shit!”

“No, I mean the layout of the path,” said Devi, gesturing down.

She pointed out the swirl of the path that guided them inward before looping back out again and onward, towards the hexagon-shaped building in front of them. It looked solid, but the windows had been covered by planks of wood, hinting at some kind of damage. She was surprised the owner left priceless art in such a shabby part of the mansion, but then supposed the pieces were too large to be moved, built as they were for the building that housed them. 

//Why… come back…//

Devi paused, listening to the crackling voice through her headphones. West and Nellie were saying something, she could see their mouths moving, but her mic was picking up static. She was sure she had heard a voice, though, not the illusion of words. She turned slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room.

//Why did… come back…//

A tune played, unfamiliar, and Devi could not tell if it was harmonizing with the voice or competing with it. 

“Anything good?” Nellie asked, her voice muffled. 

“Actually, there might be,” Devi said. “Coming from the gallery. It’s like… well, we could just be getting an errant radio signal, but I think I hear music. I think it’s coming through the mic, it’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

She did not know why she did not mention the voice. Maybe because it sounded so familiar. Maybe because she wished it was familiar.

//Why did you come back?//

No. That was not her mother. That was… this voice sounded angry. Cruel. Inhuman. The kind of voice that would be perfect for a teaser trailer. 

The static stopped abruptly. 

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said, feeling a little less anxious now that she was sure this was a generic spirit and not… well, not her mother. “Nellie, maybe you could read the guidebook entry this time? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

“Let me enlighten you,” Nellie said, plucking the guidebook from Devi’s hand. “The Gallery was renowned for housing some of the most expensive commissioned art pieces of the mid-twentieth century, some completed by world-renowned masters and others by either anonymous or unknown creatives. While some have attempted to make reproductions based on the photographs of the works, the originals have never left the property, despite numerous bids from museums and private collectors alike. Though art critics often disparaged Bradford’s taste on principle due to his children’s inclinations towards Rock n Roll, considered distinctly unclassy at the time, his manner of hoarding the pieces and their uniqueness has leant the collection considerable value. Even during the height of his life, before the deaths of any of his children, no one except a member of the Bennington family was allowed to visit the gallery. His wishes for the space to remain a sacred family space have been respected to this day.”

“That is an outdated guidebook,” West laughed.

Devi led the way into the gallery, followed by West, as Nellie trailed behind them. They kept the door open, letting the starlight illuminate the spacious room, and cast deep shadows the stretched from the larger art pieces like spirits escaping from the stone.

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped.”

So had the voice. In the shadowy darkness of the gallery, Devi wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad thing. 

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends, perhaps, who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. There was no response.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West.

“Good idea,” said Nellie, to Devi’s dismay. “Let’s poke around.”

The static stopped abruptly. 

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said, feeling a little less anxious now that she was sure this was a generic spirit and not… well, not her mother. “Nellie, maybe you could read the guidebook entry this time? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

“Let me enlighten you,” Nellie said, plucking the guidebook from Devi’s hand. “The Gallery was renowned for housing some of the most expensive commissioned art pieces of the mid-twentieth century, some completed by world-renowned masters and others by either anonymous or unknown creatives. While some have attempted to make reproductions based on the photographs of the works, the originals have never left the property, despite numerous bids from museums and private collectors alike. Though art critics often disparaged Bradford’s taste on principle due to his children’s inclinations towards Rock n Roll, considered distinctly unclassy at the time, his manner of hoarding the pieces and their uniqueness has leant the collection considerable value. Even during the height of his life, before the deaths of any of his children, no one except a member of the Bennington family was allowed to visit the gallery. His wishes for the space to remain a sacred family space have been respected to this day.”

“That is an outdated guidebook,” West laughed.

Devi led the way into the gallery, followed by West, as Nellie trailed behind them. They kept the door open, letting the starlight illuminate the spacious room, and cast deep shadows the stretched from the larger art pieces like spirits escaping from the stone.

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped.”

So had the voice. In the shadowy darkness of the gallery, Devi wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad thing. 

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends, perhaps, who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. There was no response.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West.

“Good idea,” said Nellie, to Devi’s dismay. “Let’s poke around.”

Devi lifted it, finding a small, crumpled piece of paper covered in neat handwriting. 

“There’s a letter on this bed,” she said.

“That is… shockingly convenient,” said West. 

“Maybe it’s a prop for ghost tours like us,” Nellie said. 

Devi tried to read the letter, but as she had feared, the words bled together on the page. She squinted, willing the letters to stay still, wishing she had never brought attention to it.

“Devi? Having some troubles?” West chuckled.

She couldn’t read any full sentences, but certain words jumped out at her.

//Responsibility//.

//Lonely//.

//Emma//, and then…

//Amitava//?

Amitava. That was her mother’s name. It could have been a coincidence. It wasn’t. She was sure.

“Are you too… um… unwell to keep going?” Nellie asked, actually sounding concerned.

“I’m fine,” said Devi, shoving the paper into her briefcase. “It was nothing. A grocery list.”

“Which is why you’re keeping it with you,” West said, fake nodding in agreement. 

“I said it’s nothing!” Devi snapped and her stomach flipped. She swallowed down hot bile. “Let’s just keeping looking around.”

No, wait. Those were just very big cacti. Devi giggled and told herself she was just tipsy. Definitely not drunk. 

Devi thought the flowers that bloomed from the cacti, ranging from pale pink to red, were lovely, if perhaps a “fleshy.” Like tongues. At least they looked soft…

“Ow!”

Devi pulled back her bleeding hand.

&quot;Devi, those spikes are huge,&quot; West chided. &quot;How could you not see them?&quot;

“Do you have any first aid stuff in your briefcase?” Nellie asked.

Devi nodded. Of course. She was prepared. She was professional. She was just a little bit bloody. A little bloody tipsy. Nellie reached into her briefcase and found the makeup bag she had marked with a first aid cross, unzipped it, and pulled out a roll of self-adhesive bandage.

“This will do,” she murmured, taking Devi’s hand, wrapping it so gently. 

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” Devi said, and Nellie nodded kindly, so she must have been slurring a little bit.

Devi tried to point out the swirl of the path that guided them inward before looping back out again and onward, towards the hexagon-shaped building in front of them, but couldn’t free her hand from Nellie’s insistent help. 

//Why… come back…//

Devi paused, listening to the crackling voice through her headphones. West and Nellie were saying something, she could see their mouths moving, but her mic was picking up static. She was sure she had heard a voice, though, not the illusion of words, not something imagined by a groggy mind. She freed herself from Nellie and turned slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room.

//Why did… come back…//

A tune played, unfamiliar, and Devi could not tell if it was harmonizing with the voice or competing with it. 

“I think she heard something good,” Nellie said, her voice muffled, and Devi nodded.

“Coming from the gallery,” she said, slowly, so every word was clear. Though maybe a little too loudly, based on her crewmates’ expressions. “It’s like… a song. Or not. It’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

//Why did you come back?//

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi shrugged. Probably. It would be easier to tell later if it was something good. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said, letting the cool air hit her skin and bring her back to the moment. But still, reading was out of the question. “Nellie, maybe you could read the guidebook entry this time? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

“Let me enlighten you,” Nellie said, plucking the guidebook from Devi’s hand. “The Gallery was renowned for housing some of the most expensive commissioned art pieces of the mid-twentieth century, some completed by world-renowned masters and others by either anonymous or unknown creatives.

West’s voice trailed off as Devi pushed past him, leading the way down the stairs.

“Someone’s found her backbone!” Nellie laughed.

 “Someone has to record your screams for posterity,” Devi grumbled, glad the darkness hid her blush. 
 
The red light from the camera, and the assorted lights from Devi’s recorder offered barely enough light for them to not trip over their feet on the way down, but Devi walked with false confidence. She could almost hear her mother’s voice warning her that this was a terrible idea, this was the dark underbelly of the Bennington Mansion that called her back, that swallowed her whole. But if Devi held her breath, willed it to be so, she could imagine that her mother’s voice was coming from somewhere in front of her. Deeper into the darkness. 

They walked down for a while without speaking. The only sounds for Devi to record were their heavy breaths and shoes scraping against dusty stone.  

“Is it getting lighter?” asked West.

He was right. Devi could just see the steps in front of her, enough to notice when they reached solid ground. Solid underground. A glow, gentle as misty moonlight, was coming from an object in the middle of the room.

“Is that… it looks like an altar,” said Devi.

Why was she in this basement? Why was she pretending to be brave? Why was she back in the Bennington Mansion? Before she could voice her concerns, at least the ones she was willing to share, Nellie walked towards the altar. She set a hand on the flat, round surface tracing a deep engraving that ran in two elegant lines. West approached Nellie’s shoulder, and though Devi wanted to run back upstairs, her gut told her it would be a terrible idea to split up. She stared at the image Nellie traced with an almost loving caress. 

“A ‘V,’” murmured Devi.

“Horns,” said West.

“We should leave the house,” said Nellie.

“We don’t have enough footage yet for the show,” West protested before Devi could agree. “This is cool, but it’s not like we can just be done because we found something good.”

He was right. She was overreacting. It was creepy, yes, but occult house basements were bound to be creepy. This would be good for the show. For their careers. 

“The owner doesn’t usually let investigators see the gallery, everything’s super fragile in there,” Devi said when she found her voice. “We can’t lose this opportunity. Unless… unless you’re really not feeling well or something like that?”

Nellie shrugged off Devi’s comforting hand on her shoulder and it felt like the last bit of hope for everything to be okay slipping away.

“You’re right,” Nellie said. “Both of you. I’m fine. I’ll be fine. Let’s just get to the gallery… Did you get that West?”

“Damn it, Nellie, was that a performance?”

Nellie grinned and Devi bit back an aggravated groan. 

“Back up to reality we go,” Nellie said, and Devi was only too happy to lead the way.

West’s voice trailed off as Devi pushed past him unsteadily, leading the way down the stairs.

“Someone’s found her backbone!” Nellie laughed.

 “Nope, just Bradford’s scotch!” Devi grinned. 
 
The red light from the camera, and the assorted lights from Devi’s recorder offered barely enough light for them to not trip over their feet on the way down, and Devi managed to trip over her stumbling feet a couple times anyway despite the light. She could almost hear her mother’s voice whispering a vague warning, but to Devi’s addled perception it almost sounded like the whispering voice was coming from somewhere in front of her. Deeper into the darkness. 

They walked down for a while without speaking. The only sounds for Devi to record were their heavy breaths and shoes scraping against dusty stone.  

“Is it getting lighter?” asked West.

He was right. Devi could just see the steps in front of her, enough to notice when they reached solid ground. Solid enough, though her balance insisted she was on a rocking boat. A glow, gentle as misty moonlight, was coming from an object in the middle of the room.

“Is that… it looks like an altar,” said Devi.

It was beautiful, and for a moment she understood her mother. The lure of this place, despite the danger, as addictive as the sharpest taste of confidence. Devi walked towards the altar, passing Nellie who huffed something under the breath that Devi did not bother to try to decipher. She set a hand on the flat, round surface tracing a deep engraving that ran in two elegant lines. She didn’t hear West and Nellie approach until the spoke, making her jump, which in turn made her stomach flip. 

“A ‘V?’” asked Nellie, examining the altar’s surface.

“Horns,” said West. “Creepy. But at least it makes for good footage. Makes you wonder if we even need to see more.”

“The owner doesn’t usually let investigators see the gallery, everything’s super fragile in there,” Devi protested, noticing how her voice was starting to slur. 

“I was just joking, Devi,” said West, and he and Nellie exchanged a glance. 

Devi didn’t bother deciphering it. At least they were getting along. Kind of. They didn’t even make biting comments about each other as they let Devi lead them back up the stairs.

West approached Nellie’s shoulder, and though Devi wanted to run back upstairs, her gut told her it would be a terrible idea to split up. She stared at the image Nellie traced with an almost loving caress. 

“A ‘V,’” murmured Devi.

“Horns,” said West.

“We should leave the house,” said Nellie.

“We don’t have enough footage yet for the show,” West protested before Devi could agree. “This is cool, but it’s not like we can just be done because we found something good.”

He was right. She was overreacting. It was creepy, yes, but occult house basements were bound to be creepy. This would be good for the show. For their careers. 

“The owner doesn’t usually let investigators see the gallery, everything’s super fragile in there,” Devi said when she found her voice. “We can’t lose this opportunity. Unless… unless you’re really not feeling well or something like that?”

Nellie shrugged off Devi’s comforting hand on her shoulder and it felt like the last bit of hope for everything to be okay slipping away.

“You’re right,” Nellie said. “Both of you. I’m fine. I’ll be fine. Let’s just get to the gallery… Did you get that West?”

“Damn it, Nellie, was that a performance?”

Nellie grinned and Devi bit back an aggravated groan. 

“Back up to reality we go,” Nellie said, and Devi was only too happy to lead the way.  

[[Gallery - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR with Diary)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="586" name="Gallery - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR with Diary)" tags="" position="625,1175" size="100,100">The cacti of the garden loomed like gargoyles, filling up as much space as they could beside the circling stone path. Devi thought the flowers that bloomed from them, ranging from pale pink to red, were lovely, if perhaps a little too “fleshy” to be called beautiful. Maybe it was because the cacti themselves were as tall as people, Devi found herself imagining the loose petals as flopping tongues. Her mother had never mentioned the garden. Perhaps she never made it this far into the house. The thought made Devi want to turn around, but she could not leave Nellie and West alone to wreak havoc. Even if the encircling high fence that enclosed the garden kept their havoc contained. 

“Hold that position,” West said to Nellie, who was gently caressing a petal.

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” said Devi.

“Oh shit,” said Nellie, hopping off the gravel to the dirt that surrounded it. “Did we mess up some kind of art piece? Shit!”

“No, I mean the layout of the path,” said Devi, gesturing down.

She pointed out the swirl of the path that guided them inward before looping back out again and onward, towards the hexagon-shaped building in front of them. It looked solid, but the windows had been covered by planks of wood, hinting at some kind of damage. She was surprised the owner left priceless art in such a shabby part of the mansion, but then supposed the pieces were too large to be moved, built as they were for the building that housed them. 

//Why… come back…//

Devi paused, listening to the crackling voice through her headphones. West and Nellie were saying something, she could see their mouths moving, but her mic was picking up static. She was sure she had heard a voice, though, not the illusion of words. She turned slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room.

//Why did… come back…//

A tune played, unfamiliar, and Devi could not tell if it was harmonizing with the voice or competing with it. 

“Anything good?” Nellie asked, her voice muffled. 

“Actually, there might be,” Devi said. “Coming from the gallery. It’s like… well, we could just be getting an errant radio signal, but I think I hear music. I think it’s coming through the mic, it’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

She did not know why she did not mention the voice. Maybe because it sounded so familiar. Maybe because she wished it was familiar.

//Why did you come back?//

No. That was not her mother. That was… this voice sounded angry. Cruel. Inhuman. The kind of voice that would be perfect for a teaser trailer. 

The static stopped abruptly. 

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said, feeling a little less anxious now that she was sure this was a generic spirit and not… well, not her mother. “Nellie, maybe you could read the guidebook entry this time? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

“Let me enlighten you,” Nellie said, plucking the guidebook from Devi’s hand. “The Gallery was renowned for housing some of the most expensive commissioned art pieces of the mid-twentieth century, some completed by world-renowned masters and others by either anonymous or unknown creatives. While some have attempted to make reproductions based on the photographs of the works, the originals have never left the property, despite numerous bids from museums and private collectors alike. Though art critics often disparaged Bradford’s taste on principle due to his children’s inclinations towards Rock n Roll, considered distinctly unclassy at the time, his manner of hoarding the pieces and their uniqueness has leant the collection considerable value. Even during the height of his life, before the deaths of any of his children, no one except a member of the Bennington family was allowed to visit the gallery. His wishes for the space to remain a sacred family space have been respected to this day.”

“That is an outdated guidebook,” West laughed.

Devi led the way into the gallery, followed by West, as Nellie trailed behind them. They kept the door open, letting the starlight illuminate the spacious room, and cast deep shadows the stretched from the larger art pieces like spirits escaping from the stone.

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped.”

So had the voice. In the shadowy darkness of the gallery, Devi wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad thing. 

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends, perhaps, who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. There was no response.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West.

“Good idea,” said Nellie, to Devi’s dismay. “Let’s poke around.”

West’s voice trailed off as Devi pushed past him unsteadily, leading the way down the stairs.

“Someone’s found her backbone!” Nellie laughed.

 “Nope, just Bradford’s scotch!” Devi grinned. 
 
The red light from the camera, and the assorted lights from Devi’s recorder offered barely enough light for them to not trip over their feet on the way down, and Devi managed to trip over her stumbling feet a couple times anyway despite the light. She could almost hear her mother’s voice whispering a vague warning, but to Devi’s addled perception it almost sounded like the whispering voice was coming from somewhere in front of her. Deeper into the darkness. 

They walked down for a while without speaking. The only sounds for Devi to record were their heavy breaths and shoes scraping against dusty stone.  

“Is it getting lighter?” asked West.

He was right. Devi could just see the steps in front of her, enough to notice when they reached solid ground. Solid enough, though her balance insisted she was on a rocking boat. A glow, gentle as misty moonlight, was coming from an object in the middle of the room.

“Is that… it looks like an altar,” said Devi.

It was beautiful, and for a moment she understood her mother. The lure of this place, despite the danger, as addictive as the sharpest taste of confidence. Devi walked towards the altar, passing Nellie who huffed something under the breath that Devi did not bother to try to decipher. She set a hand on the flat, round surface tracing a deep engraving that ran in two elegant lines. She didn’t hear West and Nellie approach until the spoke, making her jump, which in turn made her stomach flip. 

“A ‘V?’” asked Nellie, examining the altar’s surface.

“Horns,” said West. “Creepy. But at least it makes for good footage. Makes you wonder if we even need to see more.”

“The owner doesn’t usually let investigators see the gallery, everything’s super fragile in there,” Devi protested, noticing how her voice was starting to slur. 

“I was just joking, Devi,” said West, and he and Nellie exchanged a glance. 

Devi didn’t bother deciphering it. At least they were getting along. Kind of. They didn’t even make biting comments about each other as they let Devi lead them back up the stairs.

[[Gallery - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR Tipsy with Diary)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="588" name="The Triad - Devi&#39;s Tour (with Diary)" tags="" position="625,1300" size="100,100">Devi’s mother had not told her much about Bradfords’ lovers, so she could not guess if they had commissioned the sculpture of themselves or if it was Bradford’s decision. A statement to his devotion, to all three of them? Or a version of them he could possess and preserve? The smooth marble figures were dancing, in theory, but Devi was struck by their stillness. A mockery of moving on. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

Devi understood why he had guessed that, but she was sure her instinct was right. Even if she had no proof. Bradford wouldn’t honor any other goddesses here but the ones he had worshipped. 

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said, keeping her theory to herself.

She was getting tired, and if West and Nellie didn’t agree, she didn’t have the energy to argue. 

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“It’s A Constellation,” said Devi.

“No,” West laughed. “That’s the other-”

“Shut up, West,” Nellie huffed, smiling at Devi. “What do you mean?”

Devi pointed to the indents.

“On the one woman’s shoulder,” she said. “They’re not dots, they’re diamonds, like the sculptures in A Constellation. They’re even spaced out the same way.”

West filmed the indents, the panned across the gallery.

“Great catch, Devi!” Nellie grinned and Devi blushed.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="589" name="A Constellation - Devi&#39;s Tour (with Diary)" tags="" position="625,1300" size="100,100">Six faded white blocks of different sizes were scattered around the room. From a bird’s eye view they would look like six diamonds, stretching towards the sky. 

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi said, smiling, playing along.

If she pointed out Bradford’s lovers’ interest in astrology, the fact that the mansion had an observatory, that the lovers were known to chart the stars, it would just sound like she was lecturing them. It didn’t matter, anyway. West was still filming it. She could have Nellie record a statement about it later for a voice over in post. 

“At least this block’s big,” Nellie said. “Took some expense to make it. I appreciate the effort.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="590" name="The Fountain of Life - Devi&#39;s Tour (with Diary)" tags="" position="625,1300" size="100,100">Nellie, West, and Devi climbed onto the large stone bench that surrounded the fountain at the center of the room in a perfect connected circle. They stared into the dip of the giant bowl.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

Devi watched as Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. She didn’t stop her. The fountain was meant to be interactive. Maybe her mother had done the same thing, run her hand on that same deep curve. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

[[Gallery 1 - Devi&#39;s Tour (with Diary from The Fountain of Life)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="591" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - Devi&#39;s Tour (with Diary)" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">Devi stepped up to the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 

She recognized them all from her mother’s stories, but they were easy enough to identify, even if she didn’t have her mother’s descriptions to prompt her. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Devi knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders. It reminded her of Nellie’s cut, but a little more pampered. Self-conscious. Dawn lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Devi could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. The artist apparently chose to capture him in a precarious moment. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro almost reminded her of Sly Stone. Someone playing at being as cool as Sly. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt and bore a cruel sneer. He bullied Tara, her mother said. They would avoid him at the parties.  

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls that looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. Devi knew that she was much more comfortable in jeans, was always the most under-dressed at the parties, but Bradford’s lovers must have picked this look for her. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, uneasy… Afraid? The looked caught, trapped, desperate. Devi wondered what she was looking at, and then wondered why the artist would want to capture such an uncomfortable image. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But there was something off about him.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but only if the artist wasn’t very good at capturing likenesses. But if it wasn’t him, who could it be? 

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Not a man. Not a ghost. Not a demon. A spectre from her mother’s stories, glimpsed through a door two girls should never have been peeking through. Her mother never could describe him, just the way he made her feel. Terrified. She stepped closer to the painting, gazing at his faded eyes, and she could almost hear something. Chanting. 

No. 

Lyrics.  

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

As she reached for her equipment, a bit of the faded paint flecked off of the portrait, onto her sleeve. Not paint, at least not oil paint, but something else. Devi looked closer at the painting of the man, and saw that it had been smeared with something to purposefully cover his features. But if it was coming off, maybe it could be wiped away? She knew she shouldn’t touch the painting, but it had already been vandalized, and she needed to see him. She needed to see the monster her mother had seen. The touched the man’s face, where his jaw should have been, and was surprised that the paint was warm. Like skin.   

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members covered their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Devi heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, and Devi thought she might puke and found herself actually focusing on the sound for some kind of constant in the chaos. She picked up noises that sounded familiar, snatches of family melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Devi to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“It’s A Constellation,” said Devi.

“No,” West laughed. “That’s the other-”

“Shut up, West,” Nellie huffed, smiling at Devi. “What do you mean?”

Devi pointed to the indents.

“On the one woman’s shoulder,” she said. “They’re not dots, they’re diamonds, like the sculptures in A Constellation. They’re even spaced out the same way.”

West filmed the indents, the panned across the gallery.

“Great catch, Devi!” Nellie grinned and Devi blushed.

From a bird’s eye view they would look like six diamonds, stretching towards the sky. 

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi said, smiling, playing along.

If she pointed out Bradford’s lovers’ interest in astrology, the fact that the mansion had an observatory, that the lovers were known to chart the stars, it would just sound like she was lecturing them. It didn’t matter, anyway. West was still filming it. She could have Nellie record a statement about it later for a voice over in post. 

“At least this block’s big,” Nellie said. “Took some expense to make it. I appreciate the effort.”

[[Gallery 1 - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR with Diary from A Constellation)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="598" name="The Fountain of Life - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR with Diary)" tags="" position="625,1300" size="100,100">Nellie, West, and Devi climbed onto the large stone bench that surrounded the fountain at the center of the room in a perfect connected circle. They stared into the dip of the giant bowl.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

Devi watched as Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. She didn’t stop her. The fountain was meant to be interactive. Maybe her mother had done the same thing, run her hand on that same deep curve. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

[[Gallery 1 - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR with Diary from The Fountain of Life)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="599" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - Devi&#39;s Tour (USR with Diary)" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">Devi stepped up to the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 

She recognized them all from her mother’s stories, but they were easy enough to identify, even if she didn’t have her mother’s descriptions to prompt her. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Devi knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders. It reminded her of Nellie’s cut, but a little more pampered. Self-conscious. Dawn lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Devi could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. The artist apparently chose to capture him in a precarious moment. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro almost reminded her of Sly Stone. Someone playing at being as cool as Sly. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt and bore a cruel sneer. He bullied Tara, her mother said. They would avoid him at the parties.  

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls that looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. Devi knew that she was much more comfortable in jeans, was always the most under-dressed at the parties, but Bradford’s lovers must have picked this look for her. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, uneasy… Afraid? The looked caught, trapped, desperate. Devi wondered what she was looking at, and then wondered why the artist would want to capture such an uncomfortable image. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But there was something off about him.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but only if the artist wasn’t very good at capturing likenesses. But if it wasn’t him, who could it be? 

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Not a man. Not a ghost. Not a demon. A spectre from her mother’s stories, glimpsed through a door two girls should never have been peeking through. Her mother never could describe him, just the way he made her feel. Terrified. She stepped closer to the painting, gazing at his faded eyes, and she could almost hear something. Chanting. 

No. 

Lyrics.  

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

As she reached for her equipment, a bit of the faded paint flecked off of the portrait, onto her sleeve. Not paint, at least not oil paint, but something else. Devi looked closer at the painting of the man, and saw that it had been smeared with something to purposefully cover his features. But if it was coming off, maybe it could be wiped away? She knew she shouldn’t touch the painting, but it had already been vandalized, and she needed to see him. She needed to see the monster her mother had seen. The touched the man’s face, where his jaw should have been, and was surprised that the paint was warm. Like skin.   

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members covered their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Devi heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, and Devi thought she might puke and found herself actually focusing on the sound for some kind of constant in the chaos. She picked up noises that sounded familiar, snatches of family melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Devi to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

A statement to his devotion, to all three of them? Or a version of them he could possess and preserve? The smooth marble figures were dancing, in theory, but Devi was struck by their stillness. A mockery of moving on. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

A statement to his devotion, to all three of them? Or a version of them he could possess and preserve? The smooth marble figures were dancing, in theory, but Devi was struck by their stillness. A mockery of moving on. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

Devi understood why he had guessed that, but she was sure her instinct was right. Even if she had no proof. Bradford wouldn’t honor any other goddesses here but the ones he had worshipped. 

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said, keeping her theory to herself.

She was getting tired, and if West and Nellie didn’t agree, she didn’t have the energy to argue. 

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“It’s A Constellation,” said Devi.

“No,” West laughed. “That’s the other-”

“Shut up, West,” Nellie huffed, smiling at Devi. “What do you mean?”

Devi pointed to the indents.

“On the one woman’s shoulder,” she said. “They’re not dots, they’re diamonds, like the sculptures in A Constellation. They’re even spaced out the same way.”

West filmed the indents, the panned across the gallery.

“Great catch, Devi!” Nellie grinned and Devi blushed.

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi said, smiling, playing along.

If she pointed out Bradford’s lovers’ interest in astrology, the fact that the mansion had an observatory, that the lovers were known to chart the stars, it would just sound like she was lecturing them.

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

No, wait. Those were just very big cacti. Devi giggled and told herself she was just tipsy. Definitely not drunk. 

Devi thought the flowers that bloomed from the cacti, ranging from pale pink to red, were lovely, if perhaps a “fleshy.” Like tongues. At least they looked soft…

“Ow!”

Devi pulled back her bleeding hand.

&quot;Devi, those spikes are huge,&quot; West chided. &quot;How could you not see them?&quot;

“Do you have any first aid stuff in your briefcase?” Nellie asked.

Devi nodded. Of course. She was prepared. She was professional. She was just a little bit bloody. A little bloody tipsy. Nellie reached into her briefcase and found the makeup bag she had marked with a first aid cross, unzipped it, and pulled out a roll of self-adhesive bandage.

“This will do,” she murmured, taking Devi’s hand, wrapping it so gently. 

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” Devi said, and Nellie nodded kindly, so she must have been slurring a little bit.

Devi tried to point out the swirl of the path that guided them inward before looping back out again and onward, towards the hexagon-shaped building in front of them, but couldn’t free her hand from Nellie’s insistent help. 

//Why… come back…//

Devi paused, listening to the crackling voice through her headphones. West and Nellie were saying something, she could see their mouths moving, but her mic was picking up static. She was sure she had heard a voice, though, not the illusion of words, not something imagined by a groggy mind. She freed herself from Nellie and turned slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room.

//Why did… come back…//

A tune played, unfamiliar, and Devi could not tell if it was harmonizing with the voice or competing with it. 

“I think she heard something good,” Nellie said, her voice muffled, and Devi nodded.

“Coming from the gallery,” she said, slowly, so every word was clear. Though maybe a little too loudly, based on her crewmates’ expressions. “It’s like… a song. Or not. It’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

//Why did you come back?//

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi shrugged. Probably. It would be easier to tell later if it was something good. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said, letting the cool air hit her skin and bring her back to the moment. But still, reading was out of the question. “Nellie, maybe you could read the guidebook entry this time? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

“Let me enlighten you,” Nellie said, plucking the guidebook from Devi’s hand. “The Gallery was renowned for housing some of the most expensive commissioned art pieces of the mid-twentieth century, some completed by world-renowned masters and others by either anonymous or unknown creatives. While some have attempted to make reproductions based on the photographs of the works, the originals have never left the property, despite numerous bids from museums and private collectors alike. Though art critics often disparaged Bradford’s taste on principle due to his children’s inclinations towards Rock n Roll, considered distinctly unclassy at the time, his manner of hoarding the pieces and their uniqueness has leant the collection considerable value. Even during the height of his life, before the deaths of any of his children, no one except a member of the Bennington family was allowed to visit the gallery. His wishes for the space to remain a sacred family space have been respected to this day.”

“That is an outdated guidebook,” West laughed.

Devi led the way into the gallery, followed by West, as Nellie trailed behind them. They kept the door open, letting the starlight illuminate the spacious room, and cast deep shadows the stretched from the larger art pieces like spirits escaping from the stone. She was sure it was just her swimming vision that made it look like the shadows were dancing, but it was a mesmerizing sight nonetheless. 

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped.”

So had the voice. Oh well. 

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends, perhaps, who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. There was no response.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West.

“Good idea,” said Nellie. “Let’s poke around.”

Devi thought the flowers that bloomed from them, ranging from pale pink to red, were lovely, if perhaps a little too “fleshy” to be called beautiful. Maybe it was because the cacti themselves were as tall as people, Devi found herself imagining the loose petals as flopping tongues. Her mother had never mentioned the garden. Perhaps she never made it this far into the house. The thought made Devi want to turn around, but she could not leave Nellie and West alone to wreak havoc. Even if the encircling high fence that enclosed the garden kept their havoc contained. 

“Hold that position,” West said to Nellie, who was gently caressing a petal.

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” said Devi.

“Oh shit,” said Nellie, hopping off the gravel to the dirt that surrounded it. “Did we mess up some kind of art piece? Shit!”

“No, I mean the layout of the path,” said Devi, gesturing down.

She pointed out the swirl of the path that guided them inward before looping back out again and onward, towards the hexagon-shaped building in front of them. It looked solid, but the windows had been covered by planks of wood, hinting at some kind of damage. She was surprised the owner left priceless art in such a shabby part of the mansion, but then supposed the pieces were too large to be moved, built as they were for the building that housed them. 

//Why… come back…//

Devi paused, listening to the crackling voice through her headphones. West and Nellie were saying something, she could see their mouths moving, but her mic was picking up static. She was sure she had heard a voice, though, not the illusion of words. She turned slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room.

A tune played, unfamiliar, and Devi could not tell if it was harmonizing with the voice or competing with it. 

“Anything good?” Nellie asked, her voice muffled. 

“Actually, there might be,” Devi said. “Coming from the gallery. It’s like… well, we could just be getting an errant radio signal, but I think I hear music. I think it’s coming through the mic, it’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

She did not know why she did not mention the voice. Maybe because it sounded so familiar. Maybe because she wished it was familiar.

//Why did you come back?//

No. That was not her mother. That was… this voice sounded angry. Cruel. Inhuman. The kind of voice that would be perfect for a teaser trailer. 

The static stopped abruptly. 

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said, feeling a little less anxious now that she was sure this was a generic spirit and not… well, not her mother. “Nellie, maybe you could read the guidebook entry this time? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

“Let me enlighten you,” Nellie said, plucking the guidebook from Devi’s hand. “The Gallery was renowned for housing some of the most expensive commissioned art pieces of the mid-twentieth century, some completed by world-renowned masters and others by either anonymous or unknown creatives. While some have attempted to make reproductions based on the photographs of the works, the originals have never left the property, despite numerous bids from museums and private collectors alike. Though art critics often disparaged Bradford’s taste on principle due to his children’s inclinations towards Rock n Roll, considered distinctly unclassy at the time, his manner of hoarding the pieces and their uniqueness has leant the collection considerable value. Even during the height of his life, before the deaths of any of his children, no one except a member of the Bennington family was allowed to visit the gallery. His wishes for the space to remain a sacred family space have been respected to this day.”

“That is an outdated guidebook,” West laughed.

Devi led the way into the gallery, followed by West, as Nellie trailed behind them. They kept the door open, letting the starlight illuminate the spacious room, and cast deep shadows the stretched from the larger art pieces like spirits escaping from the stone.

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped.”

So had the voice. In the shadowy darkness of the gallery, Devi wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad thing. 

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends, perhaps, who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. There was no response.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West.

“Good idea,” said Nellie, to Devi’s dismay. “Let’s poke around.”

A statement to his devotion, to all three of them? Or a version of them he could possess and preserve? The smooth marble figures were dancing, in theory, but Devi was struck by their stillness. A mockery of moving on. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

Devi understood why he had guessed that, but she was sure her instinct was right. Even if she had no proof. Bradford wouldn’t honor any other goddesses here but the ones he had worshipped. 

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said, keeping her theory to herself.

She was getting tired, and if West and Nellie didn’t agree, she didn’t have the energy to argue. 

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“It’s A Constellation,” said Devi.

“No,” West laughed. “That’s the other-”

“Shut up, West,” Nellie huffed, smiling at Devi. “What do you mean?”

Devi pointed to the indents.

“On the one woman’s shoulder,” she said. “They’re not dots, they’re diamonds, like the sculptures in A Constellation. They’re even spaced out the same way.”

West filmed the indents, the panned across the gallery.

“Great catch, Devi!” Nellie grinned and Devi blushed.

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi said, smiling, playing along.

If she pointed out Bradford’s lovers’ interest in astrology, the fact that the mansion had an observatory, that the lovers were known to chart the stars, it would just sound like she was lecturing them.

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

Devi watched as Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. She didn’t stop her. The fountain was meant to be interactive. Maybe her mother had done the same thing, run her hand on that same deep curve.

The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 

She recognized them all from her mother’s stories, but they were easy enough to identify, even if she didn’t have her mother’s descriptions to prompt her. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Devi knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders. It reminded her of Nellie’s cut, but a little more pampered. Self-conscious. Dawn lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Devi could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. The artist apparently chose to capture him in a precarious moment. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro almost reminded her of Sly Stone. Someone playing at being as cool as Sly. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt and bore a cruel sneer. He bullied Tara, her mother said. They would avoid him at the parties.  

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls that looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. Devi knew that she was much more comfortable in jeans, was always the most under-dressed at the parties, but Bradford’s lovers must have picked this look for her. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, uneasy… Afraid? The looked caught, trapped, desperate. Devi wondered what she was looking at, and then wondered why the artist would want to capture such an uncomfortable image. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But there was something off about him.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but only if the artist wasn’t very good at capturing likenesses. But if it wasn’t him, who could it be? 

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? We never checked out the rooms to the right of the entryway. We could make time to squeeze in a few quick shots.”

Devi’s eyes caught on the locket at Dawn’s neck. She stepped closer to the painting, checking that, yes, it was the locket in her briefcase! She pulled it out to be sure, grasping the warm jewellery in her hand, and she heard a tune whispering in her headphones.  

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

She reached for her equipment and nearly lost her grip on the necklace. The chain swung loose and the locket struck the painting, chipping the color from Dawn&#39;s chest.
  
The room exploded in sound and all three crew members covered their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones, and the locket was hot against her cheek. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Devi heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, and Devi thought she might puke and found herself actually focusing on the sound for some kind of constant in the chaos. She picked up noises that sounded familiar, snatches of family melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Devi to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

A statement to his devotion, to all three of them? Or a version of them he could possess and preserve? The smooth marble figures were dancing, in theory, but Devi was struck by their stillness. A mockery of moving on. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

Devi understood why he had guessed that, but she was sure her instinct was right. Even if she had no proof. Bradford wouldn’t honor any other goddesses here but the ones he had worshipped. 

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said, keeping her theory to herself.

She was getting tired, and if West and Nellie didn’t agree, she didn’t have the energy to argue. 

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“It’s A Constellation,” said Devi.

“No,” West laughed. “That’s the other-”

“Shut up, West,” Nellie huffed, smiling at Devi. “What do you mean?”

Devi pointed to the indents.

“On the one woman’s shoulder,” she said. “They’re not dots, they’re diamonds, like the sculptures in A Constellation. They’re even spaced out the same way.”

West filmed the indents, the panned across the gallery.

“Great catch, Devi!” Nellie grinned and Devi blushed.

From a bird’s eye view they would look like six diamonds, stretching towards the sky. 

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi said, smiling, playing along.

If she pointed out Bradford’s lovers’ interest in astrology, the fact that the mansion had an observatory, that the lovers were known to chart the stars, it would just sound like she was lecturing them. It didn’t matter, anyway. West was still filming it. She could have Nellie record a statement about it later for a voice over in post. 

“At least this block’s big,” Nellie said. “Took some expense to make it. I appreciate the effort.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

Devi watched as Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. She didn’t stop her. The fountain was meant to be interactive. Maybe her mother had done the same thing, run her hand on that same deep curve. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
She recognized them all from her mother’s stories, but they were easy enough to identify, even if she didn’t have her mother’s descriptions to prompt her. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Devi knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders. It reminded her of Nellie’s cut, but a little more pampered. Self-conscious. Dawn lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Devi could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. The artist apparently chose to capture him in a precarious moment. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro almost reminded her of Sly Stone. Someone playing at being as cool as Sly. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt and bore a cruel sneer. He bullied Tara, her mother said. They would avoid him at the parties.  

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.
Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls that looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. Devi knew that she was much more comfortable in jeans, was always the most under-dressed at the parties, but Bradford’s lovers must have picked this look for her. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, uneasy… Afraid? The looked caught, trapped, desperate. Devi wondered what she was looking at, and then wondered why the artist would want to capture such an uncomfortable image. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But there was something off about him.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but only if the artist wasn’t very good at capturing likenesses. But if it wasn’t him, who could it be? 

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? I think we need to get Devi to bed.”

Devi’s eyes caught on the locket at Dawn’s neck. She stepped closer to the painting, checking that, yes, it was the locket in her briefcase! She pulled it out to be sure, grasping the warm jewellery in her hand, and she heard a tune whispering in her headphones.  

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

She reached for her equipment and nearly lost her grip on the necklace. The chain swung loose and the locket struck the painting, chipping the color from Dawn&#39;s chest.
  
The room exploded in sound and all three crew members covered their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones, and the locket was hot against her cheek. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Devi heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, and Devi thought she might puke and found herself actually focusing on the sound for some kind of constant in the chaos. She picked up noises that sounded familiar, snatches of family melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Devi to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
She recognized them all from her mother’s stories, but they were easy enough to identify, even if she didn’t have her mother’s descriptions to prompt her. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Devi knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders. It reminded her of Nellie’s cut, but a little more pampered. Self-conscious. Dawn lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Devi could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. The artist apparently chose to capture him in a precarious moment. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro almost reminded her of Sly Stone. Someone playing at being as cool as Sly. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt and bore a cruel sneer. He bullied Tara, her mother said. They would avoid him at the parties.  

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.
Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls that looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. Devi knew that she was much more comfortable in jeans, was always the most under-dressed at the parties, but Bradford’s lovers must have picked this look for her. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, uneasy… Afraid? The looked caught, trapped, desperate. Devi wondered what she was looking at, and then wondered why the artist would want to capture such an uncomfortable image. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But there was something off about him.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but only if the artist wasn’t very good at capturing likenesses. But if it wasn’t him, who could it be? 

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? I think we need to get Devi to bed.”

Devi’s eyes caught on the locket at Dawn’s neck. She stepped closer to the painting, checking that, yes, it was the locket in her briefcase! She pulled it out to be sure, grasping the warm jewellery in her hand, and she heard a tune whispering in her headphones.  

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

She reached for her equipment and nearly lost her grip on the necklace. The chain swung loose and the locket struck the painting, chipping the color from Dawn&#39;s chest.
  
The room exploded in sound and all three crew members covered their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones, and the locket was hot against her cheek. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Devi heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, and Devi thought she might puke and found herself actually focusing on the sound for some kind of constant in the chaos. She picked up noises that sounded familiar, snatches of family melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Devi to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence. 

[[Born to Run]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="675" name="The Fountain of Life - Devi&#39;s Tour (Tipsy with Diary)" tags="" position="625,1300" size="100,100">Nellie, West, and Devi climbed onto the large stone bench that surrounded the fountain at the center of the room in a perfect connected circle. They stared into the dip of the giant bowl.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Get a drink in her and suddenly she’s the queen of sass,” Nellie said, playfully raising her eyebrow.

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

Devi watched as Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. She didn’t stop her. The fountain was meant to be interactive. Maybe her mother had done the same thing, run her hand on that same deep curve. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="676" name="The Triad - Devi&#39;s Tour (Tipsy with Diary)" tags="" position="625,1300" size="100,100">Devi’s mother had not told her much about Bradfords’ lovers, so she could not guess if they had commissioned the sculpture of themselves or if it was Bradford’s decision. A statement to his devotion, to all three of them? Or a version of them he could possess and preserve? The smooth marble figures were dancing, in theory, but Devi was struck by their stillness. A mockery of moving on. She giggled and was dismayed that she burped, tasting the burn of the scotch. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

Devi understood why he had guessed that, but she was sure her instinct was right. Even if she had no proof. Bradford wouldn’t honor any other goddesses here but the ones he had worshipped. 

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said, keeping her theory to herself.

If West and Nellie didn’t agree, she was too tipsy to argue her point. 

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“It’s A Constellation,” said Devi, but the words slurred together.

The indents were diamonds, spread out like the sculptures in A Constellation. But she could see Nellie and West share a judgmental look, so she just clenched her jaw and didn’t try to explain the connection between the art pieces.

From a bird’s eye view they would look like six diamonds, stretching towards the sky. 

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi giggled.

“At least this block’s big,” Nellie said. “Took some expense to make it. I appreciate the effort.”

Not a man. Not a ghost. Not a demon. A spectre from her mother’s stories, glimpsed through a door two girls should never have been peeking through. Her mother never could describe him, just the way he made her feel. Terrified. She stepped closer to the painting, gazing at his faded eyes, and she could almost hear something. Chanting. 

No. 

Lyrics.  

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

As she reached for her equipment, a bit of the faded paint flecked off of the portrait, onto her sleeve. Not paint, at least not oil paint, but something else. Devi looked closer at the painting of the man, and saw that it had been smeared with something to purposefully cover his features. But if it was coming off, maybe it could be wiped away? She knew she shouldn’t touch the painting, but it had already been vandalized, and she needed to see him. She needed to see the monster her mother had seen. She touched the man’s face, where his jaw should have been, and was surprised that the paint was warm. Like skin.

The figures in it were life-size, but the colors were flat and dull, the already dark picture faded further from neglect and exposure. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West mused, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
She recognized them all from her mother’s stories, but they were easy enough to identify, even if she didn’t have her mother’s descriptions to prompt her. 

“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were still so bright blue under her fringe, bright enough that they could have been glistening with tears. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that Devi knew were popular in the peasant-dress fashion of the time. It was cut low in a deep sweep over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair was just a shade darker than her honey-tanned skin and fell in loose curls down her shoulders. It reminded her of Nellie’s cut, but a little more pampered. Self-conscious. Dawn lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, but Devi could just see a hint of ballet-slipper style shoes peeking out from under her, the same pale blue as her dress.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.

Mark stood beside Dawn, side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise. The artist apparently chose to capture him in a precarious moment. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves that put Dawn’s billowing dress to shame and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro almost reminded her of Sly Stone. Someone playing at being as cool as Sly. He rested one hand against the ruffles of his shirt and bore a cruel sneer. He bullied Tara, her mother said. They would avoid him at the parties.  

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls that looked unruly even in a carefully manicured portrait. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. Devi knew that she was much more comfortable in jeans, was always the most under-dressed at the parties, but Bradford’s lovers must have picked this look for her. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn, her deep brown eyes gazing not at the viewer but off to the side somewhere, uneasy… Afraid? The looked caught, trapped, desperate. Devi wondered what she was looking at, and then wondered why the artist would want to capture such an uncomfortable image. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded worse than any of the other figures. He was clearly a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting one hand on Tara’s shoulder. But there was something off about him.

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but only if the artist wasn’t very good at capturing likenesses. But if it wasn’t him, who could it be? 

“Right,” said West. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go? I think we need to get Devi to bed.”

Not a man. Not a ghost. Not a demon. A spectre from her mother’s stories, glimpsed through a door two girls should never have been peeking through. Her mother never could describe him, just the way he made her feel. Terrified. She stepped closer to the painting, gazing at his faded eyes, and she could almost hear something. Chanting. 

No. 

Lyrics.  

“Hey, guys,” said Devi. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

As she reached for her equipment, a bit of the faded paint flecked off of the portrait, onto her sleeve. Not paint, at least not oil paint, but something else. Devi looked closer at the painting of the man, and saw that it had been smeared with something to purposefully cover his features. But if it was coming off, maybe it could be wiped away? She knew she shouldn’t touch the painting, but it had already been vandalized, and she needed to see him. She needed to see the monster her mother had seen. She touched the man’s face, where his jaw should have been, and was surprised that the paint was warm. Like skin.   

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members covered their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and Devi heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building, and Devi thought she might puke and found herself actually focusing on the sound for some kind of constant in the chaos. She picked up noises that sounded familiar, snatches of family melodies and lyrics, and she realized it was not senseless, but songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for Devi to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

She tried to swallow down the choking feeling in her throat that told her she had failed. The tour was almost over and there was no sign of her mother.

“Get a drink in her and suddenly she’s the queen of sass,” Nellie said, playfully raising her eyebrow.

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

Devi watched as Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. She didn’t stop her. The fountain was meant to be interactive. Maybe her mother had done the same thing, run her hand on that same deep curve. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi giggled.

A statement to his devotion, to all three of them? Or a version of them he could possess and preserve? The smooth marble figures were dancing, in theory, but Devi was struck by their stillness. A mockery of moving on. She giggled and was dismayed that she burped, tasting the burn of the scotch. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

Devi understood why he had guessed that, but she was sure her instinct was right. Even if she had no proof. Bradford wouldn’t honor any other goddesses here but the ones he had worshipped.

If West and Nellie didn’t agree, she was too tipsy to argue her point. 

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“It’s A Constellation,” said Devi, but the words slurred together.

The indents were diamonds, spread out like the sculptures in A Constellation. But she could see Nellie and West share a judgmental look, so she just clenched her jaw and didn’t try to explain the connection between the art pieces.

Devi shook herself from her hazy thoughts and gave West a thumbs up. He frowned like he didn’t quite believe her. She didn’t quite believe herself. She tried to swallow down the choking feeling in her throat that told her she had failed. The tour was almost over and there was no sign of her mother. She was just one guest of many, one more memory haunting the Bennington mansion.

A statement to his devotion, to all three of them? Or a version of them he could possess and preserve? The smooth marble figures were dancing, in theory, but Devi was struck by their stillness. A mockery of moving on. She giggled and was dismayed that she burped, tasting the burn of the scotch. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

Devi understood why he had guessed that, but she was sure her instinct was right. Even if she had no proof. Bradford wouldn’t honor any other goddesses here but the ones he had worshipped. 

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said, keeping her theory to herself.

If West and Nellie didn’t agree, she was too tipsy to argue her point. 

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“It’s A Constellation,” said Devi, but the words slurred together.

The indents were diamonds, spread out like the sculptures in A Constellation. But she could see Nellie and West share a judgmental look, so she just clenched her jaw and didn’t try to explain the connection between the art pieces.

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Get a drink in her and suddenly she’s the queen of sass,” Nellie said, playfully raising her eyebrow.

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

Devi watched as Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. She didn’t stop her. The fountain was meant to be interactive. Maybe her mother had done the same thing, run her hand on that same deep curve. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“We can leave now,” he whispered. “We have enough footage.”

“I thought I would find her,” Devi hiccupped. 

“Find who?” West asked.

“My mother,” Devi whispered, and West’s eyebrows shot up. “She disappeared here. I wanted her to… reappear. A magic trick. Bradford was all about magic, right?”
West shook his head slowly.

“Devi, you should have told us.”

“Guys!” Nellie called to them. “We have more work to do.”

West hesitated.

“We’ll talk about this when you’re… feeling better.”

From a bird’s eye view they would look like six diamonds, stretching towards the sky. 

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked.

“I’ve never understood modern art,” Nellie sighed, staring at the largest block. “It’s very square. Rectangular.”

“It makes me feel… angular,” West nodded.

“Stop making fun of the art!” Devi giggled.

“At least this block’s big,” Nellie said. “Took some expense to make it. I appreciate the effort.”

They stared into the dip of the giant bowl.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. “Feels like a sad lesson at the end of a dark fairy tale.”

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. “And, yeah, that basically covers the point it was going for.”

“Get a drink in her and suddenly she’s the queen of sass,” Nellie said, playfully raising her eyebrow.

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip. 

The only design in the fountain was a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 
“Do you think we shouldn’t touch the bowl?” West asked.

“I think we shouldn’t have climbed on the bench, but here we are,” said Nellie.

Devi watched as Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. She didn’t stop her. The fountain was meant to be interactive. Maybe her mother had done the same thing, run her hand on that same deep curve. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

A statement to his devotion, to all three of them? Or a version of them he could possess and preserve? The smooth marble figures were dancing, in theory, but Devi was struck by their stillness. A mockery of moving on. She giggled and was dismayed that she burped, tasting the burn of the scotch. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

Devi understood why he had guessed that, but she was sure her instinct was right. Even if she had no proof. Bradford wouldn’t honor any other goddesses here but the ones he had worshipped. 

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi said, keeping her theory to herself.

If West and Nellie didn’t agree, she was too tipsy to argue her point. 

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

The women’s faces were mostly smooth moon-round planes with the faintest indents for eyes. All three had long hair, one in loose illusions of curls, one two long braids, and one done in an intricate updo. One statue’s delicate fingers held up her skirt. Another statue’s dress appeared to be falling from her shoulder, revealing impressions as faint as the eye indents, six distinct pressure points like a smattering of stars. 

“It’s A Constellation,” said Devi, but the words slurred together.

The indents were diamonds, spread out like the sculptures in A Constellation. But she could see Nellie and West share a judgmental look, so she just clenched her jaw and didn’t try to explain the connection between the art pieces.

She pulled a pencil out of her bag.

“You are not going to write on a dead woman’s poem!” West protested.

“Some of the words are faded,” Nellie insisted. “I’m just going to write them in so they show up on camera.”

“How will you know what the right words are?” Devi asked.

“Well, the verses are haikus,” said Nellie. “And you can kind of see what the words should be. We’ll just make it fit the pattern. Here’s the first verse.”

“We are in a fragile building and just experienced an earthquake, we can investigate a hot locket after we get out of this mansion!” West said, grabbing Devi’s hand.

Nellie chased after them as they ran through the garden, the swirling stones of the path a mess from the recent upheaval. They were leaving. Devi had no more answers about her mother’s disappearance than when she had arrived. She squeezed her eyes shut trying to hold in tears and heard something strange, coming from…

“Wait!” she said, digging her heels into the loose stones, skidding for a moment before West stopped dragging her forward, and Nellie collided into his back with a soft huff. 
Devi pulled on her headphones, and sure enough, her mic was picking up static, sprinkled with words. 

//Help

Her

Where//

Devi turned slowly, frustrated as she could not locate the source, more frustrated by the impatient murmurings of her crewmates that the headphones couldn’t quite block out completely. And then she realized she could not pinpoint the sound because it was not coming from around her, not from the gallery or gardens of mansion, but from the burning locket still dangling in her grasp.

“The locket is talking to me,” Devi said slowly, pulling off her headphones.

West and Nellie stared at her. And then Nellie grinned.

“Amazing!” she squealed, sweeping Devi into a hug, hissing when the locket nicked her hand. “Let’s go! We can run all sorts of tests back at the studio-”

“No.”

West&#39;s jaw opened then snapped shut.

“What are you talking about, Devi?” Nellie asked, still smiling, but it was a nervous smile now.

“I came here to find one specific ghost,” she said, teeth clenched against the truth still. “And I’m not leaving until I make contact.”

The ground began to rumble again.

“Okay,” West said, stuttering. “Okay…”

“Not okay!” Nellie shouted, bracing herself. “Devi, we have to go. We have to take the ghost we have and go!” 

[[Contact Mother in Séance Room]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="937" name="Contact Mother in Séance Room" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“The Séance Room is right by the entrance,” Devi insisted, already starting to run, followed by West and Nellie. “If you’re trying to reach a specific ghost, that’s the place to do it. I’ll just try to make contact for a second…”

“Isn’t the Séance Room a Séance Pit now?” West asked, keeping up with her as they took shaky strides through Bradford’s room, into the hallway.

“I… yes!” Devi said, gasping for breath as they ran on the ground that trembled more violently the deeper they went into the house. “But I have to try something.”

She could hear Nellie arguing with West, but she could not concentrate on them. She kept one of her headphones over her ear, listening to the static words getting picked up from the locket, listening for any other voice that might be caught by the mic or just in the halls. Her mother said she was coming here. If she had left, she would have come back to Devi, so she must still be here. She must be trying to reach out, if only Devi knew how to reach back.

Devi skidded to a halt in front of the Séance Room door. She tried the handle but it was stuck, locked, even as the old wood rattled in its frame. It was fragile, though. She could break it. She could ask West, but what if he said no, tried to convince her this was a bad idea, because it was a bad idea, but she was already backing up for a running start…

And she was suddenly airborne.

It took her a moment to realize that West had picked her up and thrown her over his shoulder. She was too shocked to move until they were already out the door.

“Sorry, Devi,” he said, tossing her into the backseat. “But I think you’ve lost it a little bit.”

“No!” Devi yelled as he slammed the door shut.

She heard the lock click in place before she could grab the handle. West hopped into the driver’s seat, Nellie jumping in beside him.

“Sorry, Devi,” Nellie said, though she didn’t sound it. “We couldn’t let you fall to your death and take..”

//And take the locket with you.//

The car tires screeched on the pavement as West drove them away. Devi held the locket tight in her palm, the heat almost unbearable against her skin. But the pain was nothing compared to the ache in her chest as she watched her mother’s final resting place shrink smaller and smaller into the distance behind them.

[[Contact Mother in Séance Room]]

[[Contact Mother in Basement]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="939" name="Contact Mother in Basement" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“The basement is right inside,” Devi insisted, already starting to run, followed by West and Nellie. “We all saw that weird altar. I’m betting the Benningtons used it to contact spirits.”

“Yeah, contact them in a way that involves a //sacrificial altar//,” Nellie protested as they ran into Bradford’s room. 

“Devi, you might be right, but there is no way we’re going down into a basement during an earthquake,” West said, grabbing Devi’s arm after she threw open the wardrobe door.

“You guys don’t have to go anywhere,” Devi said, wrenching herself free. 

“We’re not waiting for you during a natural disaster,” West said, and Devi shrugged, pulled the keys out of her briefcase and tossed them to him.

“You can’t just take…”

Nellie’s voice trailed off and her face was tense with worry. For a moment Devi faltered, until she realized Nellie was not looking at her, but at the locket in her hand.

“Whatever,” Devi grimaced, shoving the locket into West’s hands. “Good to know your priorities.”

She still hoped she would hear their footsteps following her as she ran down the steps with bleary eyes, but there was only silence behind her. She was too focused on her disappointment to notice at first how bright the stairway was now, or how the ground down here did not seem to be shaking at all. But the biggest surprise was the man who appeared to have been waiting for her, sitting cross-legged on the altar.

Devi gasped, and his head tilted slightly in her direction, a smile fluttering on his lips as she stepped closer, slowly. 

The man was handsome, Devi supposed, to those gothic girls who lusted after vampires. His skin was a little too pale, the color of someone naturally pale who has not seen sunlight in a very long time. His eyes were dark, a cloudy hazel that shifted between colors. He blinked slowly and Devi realized he could not see her, only hear her, reacting slightly to each soft breath, each footfall. His black hair was thick, pushed back from his forehead. He looked like a rockstar, or pseudo-punk, but too neatly put together for his rebellion to be anything but a performance. His black t-shirt and jeans were tight on his skinny frame, his studded thick boots looking too heavy for his body. Devi noted six distinct freckles that crossed his cheeks. He sat, waiting, with just a slight impatience.

Waiting on the altar… to be sacrificed? No. For a sacrifice. Devi’s blood ran cold. 

“I don’t know you,” the man said. “Are you a gift from Tara? Is she here?”

A gift? A sacrifice. At once, every story of her mother’s was tinged in red. People coming to the Bennington parties, unsuspecting people like her mother, joining in Bradford’s exploration of the occult, perhaps descending to his secret room once they were fully initiated, and then… Why would her mother come back if she had managed to get away? 

“Not very talkative, are you?” the man asked.

“Did Tara give you… Did Tara sacrifice my mother to you?” Devi asked. “Her name was Amitava.”

The man cocked his head.

The man&#39;s grin stretched the stars on her cheek. 

“Do you want to see her again?”

Longing like a fist gripped Devi’s throat.

“Can you show her to me?” 

“Oh yes,” said the man. “Just stay right there. I know exactly where all of them go.”

Devi held still. 

The man’s eyes went completely black. There was the rush of air, like a vacuum opening into pure space. She gasped, trying to plant herself firmly on the ground, to stay still, but the vacuum did not pull at her bodies. It was tugging at something inside of her. She felt dizzy, and fell to her knees, her vision tripling until it looked like there were three figures looming over her, grinning.

“Where…” Devi whispered, her voice sounding so far away. “My mother…”

“Oh, you sad little girl,” said the man with the night sky for eyes. “I lied.”

The last thing Devi ever heard was laughter like a song made of static.

“Devi, it’s not that I don’t believe you,” said Nellie. “It’s just that you’re… drunk. And I don’t believe a locket’s talking to you.”

“Nellie,” West started, but didn’t seem to have anything else to say.

“Locket’s talking!” Devi insisted, then shook her head. “Doesn’t matter. Wrong ghost. Not my mom.”

“What?” Nellie gasped.

“Oh shit,” said West.

“My mom’s here, somewhere,” Devi mumbled. “Her ghost. I’m not leaving ‘til I talk to her.”

“Okay,” West said, stuttering. “Okay…”

“Not okay!” Nellie shouted, bracing herself. “Devi, we have to go! Let me help you.”

[[Let Nellie Help You]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="941" name="Born to Run." tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“The locket’s hot,” Devi slurred, holding it by the chain away from her face. “Why is the locket hot?”

“We are in a fragile building and just experienced an earthquake, we can investigate a hot locket after we get out of this mansion!” West said, grabbing Devi’s hand.

Nellie chased after them as they ran through the garden, the swirling stones creating intricate patterns under Devi’s unsteady attention. They were leaving. Devi had no more answers about her mother’s disappearance than when she had arrived. She squeezed her eyes shut trying to hold in tears and heard something strange, coming from…

“Wait!” she said, digging her heels into the loose stones, skidding for a moment before West stopped dragging her forward, and Nellie collided into his back with a soft huff. 
Devi pulled on her headphones, and sure enough, her mic was picking up static, sprinkled with words. 

//Help

Her

Where//

Devi turned slowly, frustrated as she could not locate the source, more frustrated by the impatient murmurings of her crewmates that the headphones couldn’t quite block out completely. And then she realized she could not pinpoint the sound because it was not coming from around her, not from the gallery or gardens of mansion, but from the burning locket still dangling in her grasp.

“The locket’s talking,” Devi said slowly, pulling off her headphones.

West and Nellie stared at her. 

“Devi, it’s not that I don’t believe you,” said Nellie. “It’s just that you’re… drunk. And I don’t believe a locket’s talking to you.”

“Nellie,” West started, but didn’t seem to have anything else to say.

[[Let Nellie Help You]]

[[Refuse Nellie&#39;s Help]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="942" name="Let Nellie Help You" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“Fine…” Devi sighed. 

She was resigned to letting Nellie take her hand. But instead of reaching for her, Nellie reached for the locket. Devi pulled it away from her, holding it close to her chest.

“Help me?” she laughed, hearing the hysterical edge to her voice. “Or help yourself to the locket?”

“What is wrong with you, Nellie?” West asked.

Before Nellie could explain herself, the ground started shaking.

“Whatever!” Nellie shouted. “It doesn’t matter. Let’s just leave.”

“If it doesn’t matter, I’m putting it back,” Devi hissed. “This ghost doesn’t belong to us.”

Before West or Nellie could protest, Devi was already sprinting towards the library. The unsteady ground made her feel nauseous, that and the fact that she didn’t find her mom, and Nellie didn’t give a shit about her. 

She skidded into the library. The globe had fallen on its side, and bottles now rattles against the low sofas. The cloth-bound books were shaking on the shelves. Devi could see the space where the locket belonged. Devi lurched towards it and had a moment of confusion that she was not moving, until she realized Nellie was holding her shoulder. But while she glared at Nellie’s face, Nellie’s eyes were stuck on the locket. Devi pulled herself forward, dragging Nellie with her.

“Guys!” West screamed.

Devi couldn’t think, so she didn’t try. She just jumped back, tripped over one of the sofas and fell deep into the soft, sinking material. Nellie had more wits about her, so she did take a moment to look at West, to clarify, so she didn’t have time to move before the large, heavy bookshelf crashed down on top of her.

“Nellie!” Devi tried to scream, but her voice came out as a whisper. 

“Maybe she’s okay,” West said.

The floor crumpled under the weight of the bookcase, taking it, and whatever was left of Nellie’s body, into the darkness below. A new pit for the Bennington Mansion.

“Not okay, not okay,” said West, refusing to come deeper into the deteriorating room, but still holding his arms out to Devi. Devi leapt to him, and somehow he stayed on his feet, pulled her arm over his shoulder, and guided her out of the house. The locket was still in Devi’s hand, even hotter after they burst out into the cool desert air. As West fished the car keys out of Devi’s briefcase, she tried to put together what had just happened. Where there was once Nellie, there was no Nellie anymore. She couldn’t do it, so she stopped trying. 

As West careened out of the driveway, she told herself she was drunk. She had probably imagined the voice on the static. Maybe she had imagined what had happened to Nellie, too, and she would wake up tomorrow to Nellie’s grumpy morning scowl. Maybe if she could believe it, she would make it so, and West would stop crying as he drove them to safety. 

[[End of Track]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="943" name="Refuse Nellie&#39;s Help" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“No!” Devi shouted. “The basement is right inside. We all saw that weird altar. I’m betting the Benningtons used it to contact spirits.”

“Yeah, contact them in a way that involves a //sacrificial altar//,” Nellie protested, but she and West still ran after Devi as she lurched towards Bradford’s room. 

“Devi, you might be right, but there is no way we’re going down into a basement during an earthquake,” West said, grabbing Devi’s arm after she threw open the wardrobe door.

“You guys don’t have to go anywhere,” Devi grumbled, wrenching herself free. 

The ground shuddered beneath their feet. 

“Well we can’t let you go down into a basement during an earthquake all by yourself when you’re drunk!” West groaned.

“We can’t?” Nellie scoffed, but she followed West who followed Devi down.

Devi was sure it wasn’t her state that made the stairway look so bright now, stop the ground from shaking. And when Nellie gasped with her, she was positive that she was not hallucinating the man who appeared to have been waiting for her, sitting cross-legged on the altar. His head tilted slightly in her direction, a smile fluttering on his lips as she tried to step closer, before West put a warning hand on her shoulder. 

The man was handsome, Devi supposed, to those gothic girls who lusted after vampires. His skin was a little too pale, the color of someone naturally pale who has not seen sunlight in a very long time. His eyes were dark, a cloudy hazel that shifted between colors. His black hair was thick, pushed back from his forehead. He looked like a rockstar, or pseudo-punk, but too neatly put together for his rebellion to be anything but a performance. His black t-shirt and jeans were tight on his skinny frame, his studded thick boots looking too heavy for his body. The freckles on his cheeks swirled gently, but Devi was pretty sure that was her vision doubling. 

“Dawn, it’s been so long,” the man said. 

Devi frowned as the man blinked slowly, his eyes as unfocused as hers probably looked. 
He couldn’t see her. So why would he think she was Dawn?

“You’ve got the wrong girl, buddy,” said West, almost puffing up in a pathetic attempt to looking intimidating.

“I never forget a soul that was promised to me,” the man sneered, but he seemed a little less certain now.

A soul that was promised to him.

Devi held the locket out in front of her, and it burned so bright it was practically screaming. Or maybe Devi was hearing those screams in her headphones.

West put the pieces together at the same time she did but came up with a plan much faster. He grabbed the locket and tossed it at the man who fumbled to grab it from his seat. Was there something wrong with his legs? Was he stuck? What was he going to do with Dawn’s soul? Devi didn’t have time to answer these questions. West and Nellie had taken her hands and she did her best to keep up with them as they ran up the stairs, the man’s laughter echoing behind them. The ground no longer trembled, but they ran all the way to the car, and West sped them away from whatever creature they had met in the basement. Only when they could not longer see the Bennington Mansion in the rearview mirror did Devi relax, and promptly throw up in her lap.

[[End of Track]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="944" name="Landslide" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“We have to get out of here!” West said, but as Devi started to run with him, she heard something tapping, hard, against her equipment in her briefcase.

Her keys? She thought they were safe in one of the pockets. But if they scratched the equipment… yes, they needed to get out of the mansion, and had just experienced an earthquake, but she had spent a lot of money on her gear and she was not going to let it get scratched up. 

“Hold on!” she said right as they reached the looming cacti, crouching to unzip her bag.

“Devi, you better be reacting to the coolest ghost shit you’ve ever heard or I swear to god,” Nellie began, but Devi waved her silent.

Her keys were not loose. There was something sticking out of the diary they had found in the Upper Observatory. A piece of glass? She pulled out the diary, opening it up, revealing a round, smooth piece of glass. It looked clear, but as she turned it, even with almost no light to reflect, she saw a full spectrum of colors go bright then fade away.

“A compact?” Nellie asked.

“It looks like a lens,” said West, pushing up his glasses. 

A lens. For a telescope? Devi opened the diary to the page where the lens had been hidden. The writing was looping, scrawled, like it had been written by a child.

//When the sacrifice to the starless sky is complete, set the key in its place to lock the door to return Him to the void.//

Under the scrawled words was a shaky drawing of a large curving V. 

“Well, that’s ominous,” said Nellie, reading over Devi’s shoulder.

“What //key// is it talking about?” West asked, reading over Devi’s other shoulder.

She fought the urge to shrug them both off. 

“I’m more concerned about the //sacrifice//, or the //void//, or //Him//,” Devi said. “But sure, let’s focus on the key thing.”

[[The Diary is the Key]]

[[The Lens is the Key]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="945" name="The Diary is the Key" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“We have to put the diary back,” said Devi.

“Why?” Nellie asked. “That looks like the diary of a crazy person. It’s probably nothing. There’s no sacrifice. Nothing to worry about.”

But Devi could still feel the warmth of the paint under her fingers, warm like skin on the cheek of a man who was not a man. Him. The monster from her mother’s stories, the one she had spied on as the Benningtons performed their occult rituals. Instead of finding her mother’s ghost, she had a literal brush with something so much worse. And if the diary was the key, and they had the diary, then it was their job to lock awaywhat they had awakened. What //she// had awakened. 

“We need to go to the observatory,” said Devi.

“Right, because going upstairs in an unstable house during an earthquake is a good idea,” said Nellie.

Nellie continued her protests as she followed Devi, but West was silent for once. A part of her was glad to have his support. A bigger part of her wondered how he could be so convinced when he didn’t feel the painting come to life under his hand. 

When they reached the observatory, Devi paused for a moment before sliding the lens back into its place in the pages of the diary. She tucked it where she found it, behind the side table.

“Is that it?” asked Nellie. “Door closed and all? You really think that was the key? I didn’t feel anything change, and I’m really sensitive to these things.”

Instead of arguing with her, Devi just snatched the diary back, pulled out the lens, and put it over the telescope.

“Happy now?” she asked.

“Yes,” said West.

Both of the girls stared at him. Devi hadn’t noticed how tense he was until she saw him relax. 

“West?” asked Devi. “What are you-”

“We should get out of here before there are any aftershocks,” West said, cutting her off.

Devi nodded, saying nothing, and followed him down the stairs. Nellie tried to catch her eye, but she refused to look at her. Disappointment flooded her. She hadn’t made contact with her mother. And she had a feeling that they had missed out on something fantastic and life-changing, even if it was terrible. Then she felt Nellie’s lips near her ear, heard her whisper:

“He’s so moody, I&#39;d rather kill myself and haunt the Bennington Mansion than spend the next three hours in the car with him.”

Devi giggled, and in a moment of unearned confidence, slid her hand into Nellie’s, and Nellie did not pull away. Maybe she hadn’t missed out on something fantastic and life-changing after all.

“Wait,” said Nellie as Devi approached the telescope. “I’m… I’m getting a weird feeling.”

“Me too,” said Devi. “But it’ll be over soon.”

She fished the lens out of the diary as Nellie wandered to the telescope, frowning up at the clear glass ceiling.

“Does anyone else see that constellation?” Nellie asked. “I’ve never seen it before.”

Nellie bent down to look through the telescope, maybe to see the stars more clearly, but Devi didn’t get a chance to ask her what she was looking for. There was a rushing sound, like air through a vacuum, and Nellie disappeared.

Devi didn’t even feel the lens slipping through her fingers, but West must have seen it falling, because he lunged and caught it, then covered the end of the telescope.

“No!” said Devi, rushing at him, but he held her back, away from the key and the locked door to the void. “She’s… she went somewhere! Open it up, bring her back!”

Devi pushed past him, took off the lens, but Nellie didn’t reappear. If this was a door, it only went one way. West still let her try, let the tears roll down her cheeks, before he grabbed her shoulders and gently led her down the stairs. He didn’t try to explain what happened. Devi wasn’t sure if he understood any more than she did. All she knew was that Nellie was gone. And if she had just let the door stay open, if she had not made a mistake she felt a need to fix, if she had not requested they investigate the Bennington Mansion so she could hunt for a ghost she never found, Nellie would still be here.

“We need to get out of here!” said West as the ground rumbled under their feet.
“No!” Devi protested, pulling against him when he grabbed her arm. “My mom… my mom came here. Disappeared here. I thought she died but what if…”

The sacrifice…

“Why didn’t you tell us?” Nellie asked.

“Shit,” said West.

Devi sobbed, and Nellie bit her lip, looking pleadingly at West.

“Why don’t we give it a shot, West?” Nellie said. “We’ve a ghost investigating team. Something weird is happening. Maybe… Maybe it is Devi’s mom, trying to make contact, and it would suck to leave without any ghostly proof. And something strange happened in the séance room to make it, um, a pit.”

“The ground is shaking!” West protested, but Devi was already running as she wiped away her tears, Nellie close behind her. 

They ran through the mansion, reaching the fragile séance door. West huffed heavily next to her, eyeing her like he wished he could just toss her over his shoulder and carry her into the car, but Nellie warned him off with a glare.

“How do we open it?” Devi asked, her voice shaking.

West kicked the door and it flew backward, falling into the dark pit behind it.

“That works,” said Nellie. “Ok Devi, do you hear anything?”

Devi concentrated on the sound coming from her headphones. No static. No music. She got closer to the edge of the pit and peered into the darkness. She could see a faint light below her. And then suddenly a gently sound, like a rushing wind far away. Then voices, crying out, some angry, some singing, and one voice, no louder than the others but so clear to Devi.

//Devi, my girl, my darling girl…//

“Mom?” Devi asked, softly, and she felt Nellie’s hand on her shoulder, holding her back from the edge of the pit.

//My darling girl…//

“Mom, what is it?” Devi asked, watching the lights dance on her equipment as she picked up her mother’s voice.

//Devi. Run!//

The ground shook and then all the voices from that distant wind were covered by that laughter she had heard in the gallery, that terrible inhuman sound. Nellie gasped, pulled Devi back, as the ground where she had stood crumbled into the growing pit. She let her crewmates pull her away, out of the house, but only because her mother had told her to run. Her mother had spoken to her. She did it. She found her.

“Holy shit,” said Nellie as they jumped in the car, and West sped them away. “Holy shit!”

The world was spinning around Devi, but it wasn’t the alcohol that had made her dizzy. She stared down at her equipment. Her mother’s voice. The mansion was getting smaller and smaller in the rearview and Devi let out a breath of relief. Of triumph. She could decide what she would do with this information when her head was clearer. For now, she would just be happy with what she had accomplished. 

[[End of Track]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="950" name="Contact Mother Tipsy in Basement" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“We need to go to the basement,” Devi said, lurching to her feet.

“We need to get out of here!” said West as the ground rumbled under their feet.

“No!” Devi protested, pulling against him when he grabbed her arm. “My mom… my mom came here. Disappeared here. I thought she died but what if…”

//The sacrifice…//

“Why didn’t you tell us?” Nellie asked.

“Why don’t we give it a shot, West?” Nellie said. “We’ve a ghost investigating team. Something weird is happening. Maybe… Maybe it is Devi’s mom, trying to make contact, and it would suck to leave without any ghostly proof. And that basement was super weird.”

“The ground is shaking!” West protested, but Devi was already running as she brushed away her tears, Nellie close behind her. 

When they got to the wardrobe, West tried to argue again, but Nellie took Devi’s hand and West followed them down. Devi was sure it wasn’t her state that made the stairway look so bright now, stop the ground from shaking. And when Nellie gasped with her, she was positive that she was not hallucinating the man who appeared to have been waiting for her, sitting cross-legged on the altar.

The freckles on his cheeks swirled gently, but Devi was pretty sure that was her vision doubling. 

“Is that you Tara?” the man asked, his eyes catching the lens in Devi’s hand that was shifting color again. “What trick is this?”

“You’ve got the wrong girl, buddy,” said West, almost puffing up in a pathetic attempt to looking intimidating.

“My apologies,” said the man, but his eyes never even flicked to West, all of his attention of that little circle of glass. “Be careful, girl. You don’t know what you have there.”

Devi’s tongue felt thick and heavy. Nellie spoke for her.

“Why don’t you enlighten us, then?” she asked. “What do we have?”

“A key,” the man smiled. “Locking the door to everything you could ever want. Break the key, open the door. Wouldn’t that be lovely?”

Devi thought she could hear voices whispering in her headphones, but when West and Nellie gasped, she realized they could hear it, too. Some voices were arguing. Some singing. But one… 

//Devi, my girl, my darling girl…//

“Mom?” Devi asked, softly, and the man’s smile grew, distorting his freckles even more.

//My darling girl…//

“All you have to do is break the key.”

It didn’t make sense. Break a key to open a door? It didn’t make sense, but that was her mother’s voice. She wouldn’t lose this opportunity. Devi held the glass above her, reading to send it crashing to the ground, but then West was holding her wrist, pulling the lens from her grasp.

“Devi, you’re drunk but you’re not stupid,” West hissed.

“Don’t listen to him!” the man screamed. “Don’t you want to see your mother?”

His voice hurt her ears now, like the pricks of needles, and she felt her injured hand begin to bleed again. 

//Devi. Run!//

Her mother’s voice was louder than the man’s frustrated growl. She didn’t fight West and Nellie as they pushed and pulled her up the stairs and through the Bennington Mansion. 

“Holy shit,” said Nellie as they jumped in the car, and West sped them away. “Holy shit!”
The world was spinning around Devi, but it wasn’t the alcohol that had made her dizzy. She stared down at the diary in her hands, flipping through the scrawled warnings. Instructions. Maybe the man had lied, but not about everything. And West still held the key. She was suddenly glad that Nellie convinced her to take the diary. She had so much to learn. To find. Maybe, just maybe, there was a door that she could open, and her mother would be there, waiting on the other side.

“I’m more concerned about the sacrifice, or the void, or Him,” Devi said. “But sure, let’s focus on the key thing. Come on.”

“Where?” asked West.

“We need to put the lens on the telescope.”

“Why?” Nellie asked. “That looks like the diary of a crazy person. It’s probably nothing. There’s no sacrifice. Nothing to worry about.”

But Devi could still feel the warmth of the paint under her fingers, warm like skin on the cheek of a man who was not a man. Him. The monster from her mother’s stories, the one she had spied on as the Benningtons performed their occult rituals. Instead of finding her mother’s ghost, she had a literal brush with something so much worse. And if the lens was the key, and they had the lens, then it was their job to lock awaywhat they had awakened. What she had awakened. 

Nellie continued her protests as she followed Devi into the house, to the observatory, but West was silent for once. A part of her was glad to have his support. A bigger part of her wondered how he could be so convinced when he didn’t feel the painting come to life under his hand. 

“Wait,” said Nellie as Devi approached the telescope. “I’m… I’m getting a weird feeling.”

“Me too,” said Devi. 

Her mic was picking up that strange sound again, like footsteps. And it was getting louder. She rushed to fish the lens out of the diary as Nellie wandered to the telescope, frowning up at the clear glass ceiling.

“Does anyone else see that constellation?” Nellie asked. “I’ve never seen it before.”

As Nellie bent down to look through the telescope, something shifted in the wall next to Devi, and a figure came barrelling out of a door that appeared out of nowhere. It was an old woman with long, curly gray hair, apparently surprisingly strong for her age because she managed to wrest Nellie away from the telescope.

“What are you doing?” Nellie screamed as she freed herself from the woman’s grip.

“Saving your life!” the woman shouted at her. “You have no idea…”

The woman bit her tongue, shaking her head, then she turned to Devi and her eyes grew wide.

“Amitava?” she asked.

Devi shook her head slowly, shocked.

“I’m… I’m her daughter.”

Tara. This was Tara. She was alive. She was here. Didn&#39;t her mother claim that Tara had conjured the halls out of thin air? It sounded familiar. Devi thought it was magic, or drug related, but she must have been talking about secret passages. And Tara had been using them to hide in the house, all these years. 

Tara reached for the lens in Devi’s hand.

“Give that to me.”

[[Give Tara the Lens]]

[[Refuse to Give Tara the Lens]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="952" name="Evil Woman" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“We have to get out of here!” West said, but as Devi started to run with him, she heard something tapping, hard, against her equipment in her briefcase.

Her keys? She thought they were safe in one of the pockets. But if they scratched the equipment… yes, they needed to get out of the mansion, and had just experienced an earthquake, but she had spent a lot of money on her gear and she was not going to let it get scratched up. 

“Hold on!” she said right as they reached the looming cacti, crouching to unzip her bag.

“Devi, you get your drunk ass up or I swear to god,” Nellie began, but Devi waved her silent.

Her keys were not loose. There was something sticking out of the diary they had found in the Upper Observatory. A piece of glass? She pulled out the diary, opening it up, revealing a round, smooth piece of glass. It looked clear, but as she turned it, even with almost no light to reflect, she saw a full spectrum of colors go bright then fade away.

“A compact?” Nellie asked.

“It looks like a lens,” said West, pushing up his glasses. 

A lens. For a telescope? Devi opened the diary to the page where the lens had been hidden. The writing was looping, scrawled, like it had been written by a child.

//When the sacrifice to the starless sky is complete, set the key in its place to lock the door to return Him to the void.//

Under the scrawled words was a shaky drawing of a large curving V. 

“Well, that’s ominous,” said Nellie, reading over Devi’s shoulder.

“What key is it talking about?” West asked, reading over Devi’s other shoulder.

She fought the urge to shrug them both off. 

“The telescope...&quot; Devi mumbled.

“Telescope?” Nellie asked. “That looks like the diary of a crazy person. It’s probably nothing. There’s no sacrifice. Nothing to worry about.”

But Devi could still feel the warmth of the paint under her fingers, warm like skin on the cheek of a man who was not a man. Him. The monster from her mother’s stories, the one she had spied on as the Benningtons performed their occult rituals. Instead of finding her mother’s ghost, she had a literal brush with something so much worse. And if the lens was the key, and they had the lens, then it was their job to lock awaywhat they had awakened. What she had awakened. 

Nellie continued her protests as she followed Devi into the house, to the observatory, but West was silent for once. A part of her was glad to have his support. A bigger part of her wondered how he could be so convinced when he didn’t feel the painting come to life under his hand. 

“Wait,” said Nellie as Devi approached the telescope. “I’m… I’m getting a weird feeling.”

“Me too,” said Devi, the word slurring. 

Her mic was picking up that strange sound again, like footsteps. And it was getting louder. She clumsily fished the lens out of the diary as Nellie wandered to the telescope, frowning up at the clear glass ceiling.

“Does anyone else see that constellation?” Nellie asked. “I’ve never seen it before.”

As Nellie bent down to look through the telescope, something shifted in the wall next to Devi, and a figure came barrelling out of a door that appeared out of nowhere. It was an old woman with long, curly gray hair, apparently surprisingly strong for her age because she managed to wrest Nellie away from the telescope.

“What are you doing?” Nellie screamed as she freed herself from the woman’s grip.

“Saving your life!” the woman shouted at her. “You have no idea…”

The woman bit her tongue, shaking her head, then she turned to Devi and her eyes grew wide.

“Amitava?” she asked.

Devi shook her head slowly, shocked. Was she hallucinating? Did she pass out? Was she dreaming?

“I’m… I’m her daughter.”

Tara. This was Tara. She was alive. She was here. Didn&#39;t her mother claim that Tara had conjured the halls out of thin air? It sounded familiar. Devi thought it was magic, or drug related, but she must have been talking about secret passages. And Tara had been using them to hide in the house, all these years. 

Tara reached for the lens in Devi’s hand.

“Give that to me.”

[[Drunkenly Refuse to Give Tara the Lens]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="953" name="Give Tara the Lens" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“Alright,” said Devi, holding out the lens.

Tara snatched it from her, fitting it on the telescope. Devi saw her body sag in relief. 
“How did you three get in here?” Tara asked, her voice harsh but exhausted.

“We asked the owner for permission,” Nellie huffed.

“How are you not the owner?” Devi asked.

“Who is this?” West asked.

“My mother,” Tara murmured. “I bound the other two but… you must have spoken to my mother. I didn’t think she would be so reckless.”

“It’s Tara!” Nellie gasped.

“I need the two of you to figure this out faster!” Devi snapped before turning her attention back to Tara. “What did your mother do that was so reckless?”

Tara smiled, but her lips were tight and sad.

“She opened a door. A door that could swallow the world. You three need to leave.”

Devi wanted to protest. She expected Nellie or West to protest, but instead they grabbed her hands, pulling her down the stairs, through the mansion, to the car. 

“Holy shit,” said Nellie as they jumped in the car, and West sped them away. “Holy shit! West, you got that right? You were filming?”

West grinned at them through the rearview mirror. 

“You bet your ass I got it!”

Nellie turned to look at Devi.

“You’ve still got the diary, right Devi?”

Shit. She did still have the diary. She pulled it out of her bag.

“This is going to be the Best. Episode. EVER!” Nellie whooped. 

[[End of Track]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="954" name="Refuse to Give Tara the Lens" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">Devi held the lens close to her chest.

“I’m not giving you anything until you tell me what happened to my mother.”

Tara’s face fell.

“I told her not to come back. It’s not my fault she put herself in danger.”

“Is she dead?”

Tara hesitated.

“Probably.”

“What do you mean probably?”

“What the actual HELL are we talking about?” asked Nellie.

“Who is this?” asked West.

“She went through a door,” said Tara. “It only goes one way. If she is alive, it isn’t in any sense that we would understand it. She’s gone. She’s never coming back.”

“Why would she do that?” Devi asked, her voice cracking, and Tara would not meet her eyes. Devi’s flesh went cold. “Why would you do that to her?”

Tara’s eyes flashed.

“I didn’t do anything,” she snapped. “I tried to help her. I’m trying to help you.”

She lunged at Devi, but West rushed between them, pushing her back. Tara stumbled a few steps, then tripped. Her head hit the edge of the squat side table with a sharp crack.

“Oh my god,” said Nellie. “Oh my god!”

Tara slid to the floor, a pool of blood forming beneath her. Her eyes were wide, her lips moving. Devi ducked under West’s arm as he attempted to restrain her, getting close enough to hear Tara whisper.

“Lock the door… responsibility…”

Devi felt sick. She ran to the telescope, fitting on the lens on it. Nothing seemed to change, but she turned to Tara from approval anyway. The woman’s eyes were empty, cold. Somewhere, far away, Devi thought she could hear the sound of laughter being picked up by her mic.

“We need to call an ambulance,” said West. “Come on! My phone is in the car.”

They ran out the mansion, and Devi tried to fight the urge to vomit as West called the police. What were they going to do? What had they done? 

[[End of Track]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="955" name="Drunkenly Give Tara the Lens" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">“Fine,” mumbled Devi.

She held out the lens. She tried to hold onto it, but one moment it felt secure, the next it was slipping through her fingers. It felt to the floor, and Devi braced for the sound of shattering, but instead heard nothing.

“It slipped through the floor,” Nellie gasped.

The floor was half-rotted, and there were many inaccessible pockets it could have fallen into. Tara fell to her knees, almost scratching at the wood before realizing the futility. She glared at Devi, baring her teeth like an animal.

“You idiot!” she hissed, then smiled a terrible smile. “Fine. There’s more than one way to send him home satisfied.”

Suddenly, Tara’s arm was around her throat, and she was pulling Devi into the corridor she had opened behind her. Devi had a moment to see Nellie and West’s horrified faces before the secret door shut in front of her, sealing her off from rescue. She did not know if she was particularly drunk or if Tara was particularly strong, but she had no luck trying to pull free as Tara led her down uneven steps. It took all her concentration not to fall and break her neck, and even that effort was almost fruitless when Tara pushed her forward down the last few steps. 

Devi did not know where she was. Somewhere underground. And yet, there was light, coming from a round altar in front of her where a man sat cross-legged on the altar, as if he had been waiting for them. 

The man was handsome, Devi supposed, to those gothic girls who lusted after vampires. His skin was a little too pale, the color of someone naturally pale who has not seen sunlight in a very long time. His eyes were dark, a cloudy hazel that shifted between colors. His black hair was thick, pushed back from his forehead. He looked like a rockstar, or pseudo-punk, but too neatly put together for his rebellion to be anything but a performance. His black t-shirt and jeans were tight on his skinny frame, his studded thick boots looking too heavy for his body. The freckles on his cheeks swirled gently, but Devi was pretty sure that was her vision doubling. Maybe this was all a hallucination. Maybe she had passed out. Maybe she was dreaming.

“Tara, what a delicious gift you have brought me,” the man drawled. 

The man’s eyes went completely black. There was the rush of air, like a vacuum opening into pure space. Devi tried to scream but couldn’t find her breath as she felt the vacuum tugging at something inside of her. She fell to her knees, her vision tripling until it looked like there were three figures looming over her, grinning. 

The last thing Devi ever heard was laughter like a song made of static.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="956" name="Drunkenly Refuse to Give Tara the Lens" tags="" position="625,1425" size="100,100">Devi held the lens close to her chest.

“No!&quot; she said, too loudly. &quot;I’m not giving... tell me wha... bout my mother.”

&quot;What?&quot; asked Tara.

&quot;Devi, you are slurring like crazy,&quot; said Nellie. 

“Who is this?” asked West.

Tara’s eyes flashed.

“I don&#39;t have time for this,” she snapped. 

She lunged at Devi, but West rushed between them, pushing her back. Tara stumbled a few steps, then tripped. Her head hit the edge of the squat side table with a sharp crack.

“Oh my god,” said Nellie. “Oh my god!”

Tara slid to the floor, a pool of blood forming beneath her. Her eyes were wide, her lips moving. Devi tried to get to her, to listen to what she was saying, but West restrained her, pulling her away from the old woman whose lips had already gone still. 

“We need to call an ambulance,” said West. “Come on! My phone is in the car.”

They ran out the mansion, and Devi tried to fight the urge to vomit as West called the police. She had a terrible feeling, not just about the dead woman. Like they had forgotten to do something important. Like the worst was yet to come. 

Somewhere, far away, Devi thought she could hear the sound of laughter being picked up by her mic.

[[End of Track]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="957" name="Hallway 1 - West&#39;s Tour" tags="" position="850,425" size="100,100">“Left, to the Séance Pit!” West announced.

“Please avoid the Séance Pit,” Devi said, stumbling after West and Nellie. “The door to the pit is really fragile so just… don’t touch it. West.”

West realized he was leaning towards the Séance Pit door, but it was only because of the sudden appearance of ghost who looked as shocked to see him as he was to see her. She had deep black almond eyes and a messy cropped haircut. Her fringe vest gave her a friendly 70s folksy vibe that was negated by the angry energy she focused on West before disappearing through the door into the Groove Room. 

“If anyone is touching things she shouldn’t, it’s Nellie!” West protested, pulling himself away from the door now that the ghost had left them more room in the hallway.

“Wow, just because of that accusation, I’m going to touch *everything*,” Nellie said, glaring at West.

“I’m in charge, and therefore, I will decide who touches what,” West argued.

“Typical man,” said Nellie, but she wandered away to examine the photos on the wall before West could defend himself. 

Devi signalled for West to film while she also explored the photos. West had trouble focusing on the pictures that flashed between their faded state and the bright images they once were. Some of the people’s eyes shifted, like they were watching him back. He would probably pick up those flickers on camera. Which would be great for their ghost show. Flickering footage had gotten West fired from plenty of previous gigs. 

The worst photos were the ones of the Bennington children. He had a better idea of what the kids looked like from the dancing color-block illustrations in the guide book than by looking at actual photos of them that were humming with spectral energy. It was a little easier to focus on the other faces in the photos, which were surprisingly familiar…

“Is that David Bowie?” Devi finally asked.

Nellie startled next to her, as if she had not been looking at the same exact picture of the same exact famous popstar. 

“Oh shit, it is!” said West. “Holy shit, Mick Jagger’s in this pic!”

West realized that the photos were studded with rock, pop, and folk stars who reached their heights in the 70s. If he didn’t pull his starstruck crewmates away from the photos they would be admiring them for hours. And he didn’t think the leftover energy the Bennington children had left in their particular photos were appreciating the scrutiny. 

Or else they were always in a bad mood. Either way.

“Time to move on,” West announced.

If you try to enter it, you will fall and die.”

West stepped back, mumbling some kind of protest. He couldn’t recognize at first that he was drawn to the door, and when he realized why, his blood ran cold. There was no spectral energy coming from the door. There was no energy at all, not even lingering memories. Not even the usual negative haunted energies of fear or sadness. It really was a pit. 

Devi was looking at him funny, or maybe just judgementally, but West felt the need to shake off his sudden discomfort. 

“The door is pretty rotted,” West said. “Not much protection from such a dangerous pit. Hell, I bet I could kick it down.”

“It’s so rotted I could kick it down,” Nellie said, squaring up like she was about to try.

“No one’s kicking down any doors,” Devi groaned.

West wasn’t worried about the pit for the same reasons as Devi, but it did worry him. He had a bad feeling about the feelingless pit. He had a bad feeling about this mansion. 

“We were just joking, Devi,” West said, forcing a grin. “And now we’re just wasting time we don’t have, and I need to keep us on schedule.&quot;

West was distracted by the images in loop of women getting ready, the faded memory projected across the weirdly moist tiles, but he still got some good footage of Nellie staring pensively into the bathroom mirror.

He pulled out the guidebook, clanking at an illustration that looked like a more solid version of the image he was glimpsing, three women in elegant pink house robes delicately powdering their face, brushing their hair, putting on lipstick. 

“All the girls shared this bathroom,” said Devi.

“Both the daughters had to share in a mansion?” Nellie asked, incredulous.

“Both the daughters and Bradfords’ three lovers,” Devi clarified. 

“I forgot about the three lovers, all living together,” Nellie shuddered. “Bradford was such a misogynist.”

“Free love isn’t inherently misogynistic,” West protested. 

“If you want bathroom footage, you’ll have to film here,” Devi interrupted before Nellie could really wind up West. “There was an issue with the plumbing about ten years ago and Bradford and Mark’s private bathrooms got wrecked. The owner sealed them shut. We’ll see the doors in their bedrooms, but that’s it. I’m not picking anything up on the mics, but if any of this looks particularly compelling to you, we can have a closer look.”

West knew it wasn’t real, but he was dazzled by the brightly lit disco ball lazily spinning designs across the ghostly partiers still grooving, illuminated by a memory stronger than tonight’s gentle moonlight he could barely see through the small porthole windows. Short steps led down to an indented dance floor filled with shimmering dancers with flared trousers, scarf shirts, drooping necklaces, and voluminous hair. West filmed the dancers under the disco ball, realized no one else would see them on the film, and turned his camera to the stairs leading up to a second floor as if he had just been panning across the room.

“This place is…” West began.

“I know,” said Nellie, her voice full of awe, and he wondered if she was getting some kind of ghostly after-image too, if she could feel the welcoming presence of the Groove Room.

Well, from the first floor of the Groove Room. The upper floor had strange vibes. Dark. 
Devi was listening intently to her headphones.

“What’s going on?” asked West, setting his camera on his shoulder.

“I might be picking something up.”

“Something spooky?”

Devi nodded.

“A song. Kind of.”

She didn’t elaborate.

Nellie had moved to the center of the dance floor, and West filmed her as she grooved among the apparitions, swaying her hips along with the beat that he could almost hear. 

“Doing okay, Nellie?” West asked with a chuckle.

She gave a few extra turns just for the camera.

“Anything ghostly going on?” she asked them when she was done.

“Devi thought she heard a song,” West said.

“A disco song?” Nellie asked.

“It was quiet,” said Devi. “Hard to make out. I’ll play it back when we get home.”

“I bet it was contact,” Nellie grinned, making Devi blush, before she turned to West. “Anything good in the guidebook?”

The color-block pictures looked pathetic compared to the real thing. He stared at each figure, looking for a girl with shaggy black hair, but whoever the ghost was who had disappeared into this room, she wasn’t important enough for the artist to draw. West didn’t see her in the crowd. He wondered if she was upstairs, if she was that dark presence he felt, but she didn’t think they were the same spirit. She just seemed pissed. The spirit upstairs was malevolent. The stairs to the upper floor were depicted in the picture, and three women in flowing gowns were on their way up the steps, beckoning at the reader, inviting them to follow. 

“I wonder what’s upstairs,” said West.

“You could read the guidebook and find out,” said Nellie.

“It’s the Upper Séance Room,” Devi interrupted. “It was damaged in the same explosion as the Séance Pit. Probably too dangerous to check it out. But I guess it’s up to you, West.”

“It’s just mold,” West said, wiping the thick substance that was almost definitely not just mold off his hand, onto his jeans. “You girls are so squeamish.”

He wiped until there wasn’t anything visibly left on his fingers, but he still felt that black-green muck coating his skin. If he focused too much on the feeling, it sort of felt like it was spreading, but that was probably something malicious messing with his senses. He fought the urge to glare at Nellie. She was supposedly the sensitive one. If a ghost was going to mess with anyone, it should have been her. He was almost positive that if Nellie had explored first, she also would have touched the sludge in the tub.

“West, what are you doing?” Devi asked, horrified.

“This is what happens when you let West explore first,” Nellie laughed, shaking her head.

“It’s just mold,” West said, wiping the thick substance that was almost definitely not just mold off his hand, onto his jeans. “You girls are so squeamish.”

He wiped until there wasn’t anything visibly left on his fingers, but he still felt that black-green muck coating his skin. If he focused too much on the feeling, it sort of felt like it was spreading, but that was probably something malicious messing with his senses. He fought the urge to glare at Nellie. She was supposedly the sensitive one. If a ghost was going to mess with anyone, it should have been her. He was almost positive that if Nellie had explored first, she also would have touched the sludge in the tub.

West knew it wasn’t real, but he was dazzled by the brightly lit disco ball lazily spinning designs across the ghostly partiers still grooving, illuminated by a memory stronger than tonight’s gentle moonlight he could barely see through the small porthole windows. Short steps led down to an indented dance floor filled with shimmering dancers with flared trousers, scarf shirts, drooping necklaces, and voluminous hair. West filmed the dancers under the disco ball, realized no one else would see them on the film, and turned his camera to the stairs leading up to a second floor as if he had just been panning across the room.

“This place is…” West began.

“I know,” said Nellie, her voice full of awe, and he wondered if she was getting some kind of ghostly after-image too, if she could feel the welcoming presence of the Groove Room.

Well, from the first floor of the Groove Room. The upper floor had strange vibes. Dark. 
Devi was listening intently to her headphones.

“What’s going on?” asked West, setting his camera on his shoulder.

“I might be picking something up.”

“Something spooky?”

Devi nodded.

“A song. Kind of.”

She didn’t elaborate.

Nellie had moved to the center of the dance floor, and West filmed her as she grooved among the apparitions, swaying her hips along with the beat that he could almost hear. 

“Doing okay, Nellie?” West asked with a chuckle.

She gave a few extra turns just for the camera.

“Anything ghostly going on?” she asked them when she was done.

“Devi thought she heard a song,” West said.

“A disco song?” Nellie asked.

“It was quiet,” said Devi. “Hard to make out. I’ll play it back when we get home.”

“I bet it was contact,” Nellie grinned, making Devi blush, before she turned to West. “Anything good in the guidebook?”

The color-block pictures looked pathetic compared to the real thing. He stared at each figure, looking for a girl with shaggy black hair, but whoever the ghost was who had disappeared into this room, she wasn’t important enough for the artist to draw. West didn’t see her in the crowd. He wondered if she was upstairs, if she was that dark presence he felt, but she didn’t think they were the same spirit. She just seemed pissed. The spirit upstairs was malevolent. The stairs to the upper floor were depicted in the picture, and three women in flowing gowns were on their way up the steps, beckoning at the reader, inviting them to follow. 

“I wonder what’s upstairs,” said West.

“You could read the guidebook and find out,” said Nellie.

“It’s the Upper Séance Room,” Devi interrupted. “It was damaged in the same explosion as the Séance Pit. Probably too dangerous to check it out. But I guess it’s up to you, West.”

The pictures had gone inactive, but his camera had not. The image kept glitching, shifting colors, showing shadows that were not there. The kind of activity that got him fired from traditional sets. The results that Nellie lived for. West had tried to quit in the past, but it was hard to find people outside the paranormal field who were fine with haunted footage. It didn’t matter. On the last few haunts, he had felt less like a witness and more like a potential player. Like how Nellie described her own gift, which always sounded to him like a vulnerability more than a blessing. 

“Is anyone else chilly?” Nellie asked.

“Nope,” said West, truthfully, but that didn’t mean Nellie was lying. “Maybe it’s a ghost?”

“West. Film,” Nellie demanded, before turning to the red light and smirking. “I think we have company, viewers. Does anyone want to make contact? It’s safe here. We’re listening.”

Despite the silliness of its name, Spooktacular Investigations didn’t use EVP, radio channels, any of the tricks popular on other streaming shows because as far as their Nellie was concerned, they were just tricks. And she was right. And between the three of them, or even just with West’s influence, they didn’t need them. They waited a minute in silence. 

“Guess they’re shy,” Nellie said, shrugging at the camera. “We’ve got some chilly, shy ghosts or demons in the mansion.”

“Maybe I should play ‘Running With the Devil,’” Devi suggested. 

“Only if we’re desperate for contact,” Nellie said. “Okay West, I’ve had enough of this popcorn ceiling for a lifetime. What does the guidebook say?”

West flipped open the book to the entry for the Bradford children’s bedrooms. There were those dancing figures from the beginning of the guidebook again, each standing under a shadowed archway now. Not dancing. Leaning, tired. It was a weird pose for a guidebook. They didn’t look particularly welcoming, and West doubted their ghosts would be more welcoming to people invading the privacy of their bedrooms. The man with the afro stood under an arch with an M at the top, the blond woman under an arch labelled D, and the girl with dark ringlets under the arch labelled T. West looked up at the molding mantels above each bedroom door, where pieces of metal twisted into the shape of a letter were still securely nailed: M, T, D. He pointed it out to the crew.

“Mark, Tara, Dawn,” he said. “The Bradford children. We probably have time to explore two of the rooms.”

If you try to enter it, you will fall and die.”

West stepped back, mumbling some kind of protest. He couldn’t recognize at first that he was drawn to the door, and when he realized why, his blood ran cold. There was no spectral energy coming from the door. There was no energy at all, not even lingering memories. Not even the usual negative haunted energies of fear or sadness. It really was a pit. 

Devi was looking at him funny, or maybe just judgementally, but West felt the need to shake off his sudden discomfort. 

“The door is pretty rotted,” West said. “Not much protection from such a dangerous pit. Hell, I bet I could kick it down.”

“It’s so rotted I could kick it down,” Nellie said, squaring up like she was about to try.

“No one’s kicking down any doors,” Devi groaned.

West wasn’t worried about the pit for the same reasons as Devi, but it did worry him. He had a bad feeling about the feelingless pit. He had a bad feeling about this mansion. 

“We were just joking, Devi,” West said, forcing a grin. “And now we’re just wasting time we don’t have, and I need to keep us on schedule.&quot;

Nellie had moved to the center of the dance floor, and West filmed her as she grooved among the apparitions, swaying her hips along with the beat that he could almost hear. 

“Doing okay, Nellie?” West asked with a chuckle.

She gave a few extra turns just for the camera.

“Anything ghostly going on?” she asked them when she was done.

“Devi thought she heard a song,” West said.

“A disco song?” Nellie asked.

“It was quiet,” said Devi. “Hard to make out. I’ll play it back when we get home.”

“I bet it was contact,” Nellie grinned, making Devi blush, before she turned to West. “Anything good in the guidebook?”

The color-block pictures looked pathetic compared to the real thing. He stared at each figure, looking for a girl with shaggy black hair, but whoever the ghost was who had disappeared into this room, she wasn’t important enough for the artist to draw. West didn’t see her in the crowd. He wondered if she was upstairs, if she was that dark presence he felt, but she didn’t think they were the same spirit. She just seemed pissed. The spirit upstairs was malevolent. The stairs to the upper floor were depicted in the picture, and three women in flowing gowns were on their way up the steps, beckoning at the reader, inviting them to follow. 

“I wonder what’s upstairs,” said West.

“You could read the guidebook and find out,” said Nellie.

“It’s the Upper Séance Room,” Devi interrupted. “It was damaged in the same explosion as the Séance Pit. Probably too dangerous to check it out. But I guess it’s up to you, West.”

If you try to enter it, you will fall and die.”

West stepped back, mumbling some kind of protest. He couldn’t recognize at first that he was drawn to the door, and when he realized why, his blood ran cold. There was no spectral energy coming from the door. There was no energy at all, not even lingering memories. Not even the usual negative haunted energies of fear or sadness. It really was a pit. 

Devi was looking at him funny, or maybe just judgementally, but West felt the need to shake off his sudden discomfort. 

“The door is pretty rotted,” West said. “Not much protection from such a dangerous pit. Hell, I bet I could kick it down.”

“It’s so rotted I could kick it down,” Nellie said, squaring up like she was about to try.

“No one’s kicking down any doors,” Devi groaned.

West wasn’t worried about the pit for the same reasons as Devi, but it did worry him. He had a bad feeling about the feelingless pit. He had a bad feeling about this mansion. 

“We were just joking, Devi,” West said, forcing a grin. “And now we’re just wasting time we don’t have, and I need to keep us on schedule.&quot;

West knew it wasn’t real, but he was dazzled by the brightly lit disco ball lazily spinning designs across the ghostly partiers still grooving, illuminated by a memory stronger than tonight’s gentle moonlight he could barely see through the small porthole windows. Short steps led down to an indented dance floor filled with shimmering dancers with flared trousers, scarf shirts, drooping necklaces, and voluminous hair. West filmed the dancers under the disco ball, realized no one else would see them on the film, and turned his camera to the stairs leading up to a second floor as if he had just been panning across the room.

“This place is…” West began.

“I know,” said Nellie, her voice full of awe, and he wondered if she was getting some kind of ghostly after-image too, if she could feel the welcoming presence of the Groove Room.

Well, from the first floor of the Groove Room. The upper floor had strange vibes. Dark. 
Devi was listening intently to her headphones.

“What’s going on?” asked West, setting his camera on his shoulder.

“I might be picking something up.”

“Something spooky?”

Devi nodded.

“A song. Kind of.”

She didn’t elaborate.

“Are we moving on?” asked Nellie.

“What?” asked West, pulling his eyes from a photo of a sneering man lounging between two rockstars who was looking right at him. Terror shone through his eyes.

Why was he scared? He was already dead. What did he have to be scared of? 

“West?” asked Devi. “Another room, or keep going?”

“Right,” West said, shaking his head. “Sorry. Follow me.”

West’s eyes flicked to Devi, but if she had been picking up this singer’s song before, her mic wasn’t picking anything up right now. The ghost caught his gaze and stopped singing. She pointed back to the stairs, frowning, mouthing something angrily. West didn’t want to ignore her obvious warning, but she couldn’t come up just to immediately turn back around without having a real explanation. And he refused to let Nellie know. Nellie, who would exploit anything, even her own abilities or mental health issues, for a few hundred streaming views. 

But there were other ways to ensure a quick exit.

“West, back away from the giant hole in the floor!” Devi begged. 

West leaned over further, filming into the pit, Nellie eagerly peering over at his side. He could hear something, faintly, from inside. Voices, ghostly and sorrowful. And every so often, a faint impossible breeze, an echo of a much more powerful gust of air from centuries ago. He was glad he hadn&#39;t tested the fragile door to the Séance Room downstairs. He could imagine breaking it, falling through, and then... well he didn&#39;t want to imagine that.

“What happened here?” asked Nellie. “Does the guidebook say anything?”

Devi spoke before West could check.

“An earthquake at the time caused structural damage to a lot of the mansion and is said to have upset some poorly made support beams that collapsed, making the center of the floor collapse,” she said. “But some people think there was an explosion of dark energy after a séance went wrong, and the explosion caused the hole...”

Devi was still speaking, but West did not hear her. An vision flashed in front of his eyes, three pairs of hands with elegant manicures holding up a burlap sack of a doll, just the suggestion of a head torso and limbs, that flopped in their hands. Flopped wetly, with a squelching sound that made West’s stomach flip. A man was screaming, like his heart was being torn out, and the seems of the doll began to split, and green-black sludge dripped from the openings, before… Darkness. A shrieking vacuum of darkness.

Devi’s hand was on his shoulder, and he though she had noticed his distraction, but she was hardly paying attention to him, all her focus spent on frowning at her equipment.
“If we stay here any longer one of you is falling into the pit,” she said.

“Is that a warning or a threat?” Nellie laughed.

“She’s right,” West said, and he noticed the guitar playing ghost was gone. “We’re done here.”

I’m not picking anything up on the mics, but if any of this looks particularly compelling to you, we can have a closer look.”

“West, what are you doing?” Devi asked, horrified.

“This is what happens when you let West explore first,” Nellie laughed, shaking her head.

“It’s just mold,” West said, wiping the thick substance that was almost definitely not just mold off his hand, onto his jeans. “You girls are so squeamish.”

He wiped until there wasn’t anything visibly left on his fingers, but he still felt that black-green muck coating his skin. If he focused too much on the feeling, it sort of felt like it was spreading, but that was probably something malicious messing with his senses. He fought the urge to glare at Nellie. She was supposedly the sensitive one. If a ghost was going to mess with anyone, it should have been her. He was almost positive that if Nellie had explored first, she also would have touched the sludge in the tub.

The brown sludge seemed to originate from under a door at the far end of the room that was nailed shut with large pieces of wood, the freshest items in the room. Everything else, from the soggy remains of poster drooping from nails in the wall, to the marshy remains of a bedspread on the once proud and now rotting wooden frame, had been taken over by the sludge. It didn’t feel ghostly, but it didn’t seem normal either. 

“I can’t believe you touched that stuff,” Devi said, hand covering her nose and mouth.

West wiped his hand against his pants again. There was no sign of the sludge on his skin, but when he looked at it pooling out from the door, he could feel it. Creeping along him. Seeping inside.

“West, camera on me, we’re going to be quick about this,” Nellie said. 

West balanced the camera on his shoulder, clumsily flipped through the guidebook with his free hand. He found a picture of Mark, playing a guitar. 

“Does anyone see a guitar in all this?” West asked, looking at the lumpy shapes in the room.

“Mark’s missing body could be rotting here and I wouldn’t be able to tell,” said Devi. “They say Bradford buried his body in the garden after they had a huge blow out, but maybe he just left it here.”

“That would explain the smell,” Nellie gagged. 

West shoved the guidebook in his pocket, giving a final glance around the room for something almost appealing to film, and the dull light from his camera was briefly reflect back to him on the tiniest object in the corner of the room. He leaned down, reaching towards it.

“Don’t touch the sludge!” Devi chided.

“I’m not!” said West.

He picked up a small bit of plastic. A guitar pick. 

“Good find,” said Nellie. “If it’s Mark’s, that is. If it was left by some tourist, it’s a stupid find and we’re wasting time in a disgusting room talking about it.”

“The fumes are getting to me,” said Devi. “Let’s go, please.”

“Yes, Nellie, obviously.”

The room was very dark. It was sandwiched between the hall and Dawn’s room, so there were no porthole windows to let in the scant starlight that lit the rest of the house. But even in the dull glow of the camera’s light, it was clear that this room had been spared the years of rot and disrepair they had seen elsewhere in the mansion. The bed even looked freshly made, turned down, ready for an occupant to slip inside. There was a teddy bear on a pillow. But West could barely see any of this mundane backdrop beneath the layers of ghostly after images. Not spirits, there was no consciousness in these shades that lay as thick as the sludge that plagued the Bennington plumbing. They were barely memories. Just trauma that could not quite pass on, held in  Tara’s bedroom by… what? Usually trauma echoes were hitched to this reality by guilt. But there was no one left in the Bennington mansion to feel guilty, nothing to hold on to this lingering despair. 

Nellie was practically wading through them in her effort to explore the room and possibly steal the teddy bear, completely unaware of the distressed broken shapes she left in her wake. 

“You should get in the bed,” West whispered.

“I am not getting in the bed,” Nellie whispered back.

“Guys, please don’t whisper,” Devi sighed. “The mics won’t pick you up if you keep whispering.”

West flipped to Tara’s page in the guidebook, that showed an artistic picture of a girl who was more curls and ruffles than human being. 

“She looks pretty harmless,” West said, his eyes flicking to the shades that had congealed in the girl’s room. 

“Don’t trust appearances,” said Devi. “She was Bradford’s protégée in the dark arts. Apparently she was as skilled as him at communing with dark forces.”

“I believe it,” West said under his breath. 

“I wonder if she wanted that magic,” Nellie asked, surprisingly thoughtful. “Or if she resented the pressure of being Bradford’s favourite.”

West shared a look with Devi. They hadn’t said anything about favourites, but it felt true. 

“Well, maybe, maybe not,” said Devi. “After her siblings died and Bradford’s lovers abandoned him, Tara stayed, and took care of Bradford in his old age. She was supposedly at his side when he died, and then she fled. Disappeared. There were some rumors that she killed Bradford as revenge for her siblings’ misfortunes, or because of the evil magic he made her do. Or because she wanted to absorb his power.”

“Weird,” said West. Had the layer of shades gotten thicker as they spoke? Or wetter? Grosser? “We should go.”

West would have assumed a poltergeist had made its way through the eldest Bradford child’s room, but there was an almost disturbing lack of ghostly presence here. The jagged scratches on the walls, teeth marks on the bedposts, and crushed costume jewellery on the floor did not reflect a hint of a memory. As much as West was tired of ghosts in his life, the complete lack of ghosts in a clearly haunted mansion made the hair rise on the back of his neck. 

Where was Dawn? Did she actually move on? West didn’t think so. 

He opened up the guidebook and frowned at the illustration. The blond woman with the feathered fringe was clearly supposed to be Dawn. There was another figure, sitting by her feet. With a messy cropped haircut, strumming a guitar.

“Who’s that?” West asked Devi as Nellie admired the broken costume jewellery. 

“If you read the entry, you would find out,” Devi huffed.

“I know you know, just tell me,” West said, sharper than he intended.

“Someone’s being bitchy, and it’s not me, which is weird,” Nellie muttered into her mic.

The comment softened Devi’s glare and she shrugged, pointing to the mystery ghost.

“That was Dawn’s girlfriend, Emma, a folksinger. They kept their relationship a secret because they were worried how Dawn’s family would react, with Emma not being rich or connected or anything. But Mark found out and told Bradford, and Bradford forbade Dawn from ever seeing Emma again, and the singer disappeared. Some legends say he arranged for Emma to be murdered, or sacrificed her to a dark spirit. Which sounds insane, even for an occult family, but might actually be true because Dawn committed suicide not long after Emma disappeared. She hanged herself in the Upper Séance room with her own bedsheets...”

Devi’s voice trailed off when they heard Nellie sniffle.

She was holding a few of the broken jewellery pieces in her hands. West was not sure if he had ever seen her cry. Or show a genuine emotion. He filmed her, even though it made him feel like a dick. 

“Nel, do you need a sec?” West asked. “Or a tissue?”

“No,” Nellie said. “It’s just… dusty. We can keep going.”

“Who’s that?” West asked Devi as Nellie admired the broken costume jewellery. 

“If you read the entry, you would find out,” Devi huffed.

“I know you know, just tell me,” West said, sharper than he intended.

“Someone’s being bitchy, and it’s not me, which is weird,” Nellie muttered into her mic.

The comment softened Devi’s glare and she shrugged, pointing to the mystery ghost.

“That was Dawn’s girlfriend, Emma, a folksinger. They kept their relationship a secret because they were worried how Dawn’s family would react, with Emma not being rich or connected or anything. But Mark found out and told Bradford, and Bradford forbade Dawn from ever seeing Emma again, and the singer disappeared. Some legends say he arranged for Emma to be murdered, or sacrificed her to a dark spirit. Which sounds insane, even for an occult family, but might actually be true because Dawn committed suicide not long after Emma disappeared. She hanged herself in the Upper Séance room with her own bedsheets...”

Devi’s voice trailed off when they heard Nellie sniffle.

She was holding a few of the broken jewellery pieces in her hands. West was not sure if he had ever seen her cry. Or show a genuine emotion. He filmed her, even though it made him feel like a dick. 

“Nel, do you need a sec?” West asked. “Or a tissue?”

“No,” Nellie said. “It’s just… dusty. We can keep going.”

The brown sludge seemed to originate from under a door at the far end of the room that was nailed shut with large pieces of wood, the freshest items in the room. Everything else, from the soggy remains of poster drooping from nails in the wall, to the marshy remains of a bedspread on the once proud and now rotting wooden frame, had been taken over by the sludge. It didn’t feel ghostly, but it didn’t seem normal either. 

“I can’t believe you touched that stuff,” Devi said, hand covering her nose and mouth.

West wiped his hand against his pants again. There was no sign of the sludge on his skin, but when he looked at it pooling out from the door, he could feel it. Creeping along him. Seeping inside.

“West, camera on me, we’re going to be quick about this,” Nellie said. 

West balanced the camera on his shoulder, clumsily flipped through the guidebook with his free hand. He found a picture of Mark, playing a guitar. 

“Does anyone see a guitar in all this?” West asked, looking at the lumpy shapes in the room.

“Mark’s missing body could be rotting here and I wouldn’t be able to tell,” said Devi. “They say Bradford buried his body in the garden after they had a huge blow out, but maybe he just left it here.”

“That would explain the smell,” Nellie gagged. 

West shoved the guidebook in his pocket, giving a final glance around the room for something almost appealing to film, and the dull light from his camera was briefly reflect back to him on the tiniest object in the corner of the room. He leaned down, reaching towards it.

“Don’t touch the sludge!” Devi chided.

“I’m not!” said West.

He picked up a small bit of plastic. A guitar pick. 

“Good find,” said Nellie. “If it’s Mark’s, that is. If it was left by some tourist, it’s a stupid find and we’re wasting time in a disgusting room talking about it.”

“The fumes are getting to me,” said Devi. 

West frowned as he stared at piece of the bedframe that had not completely rotted.

“There’s some kind of message scratched on here,” West said, leaning down to read it more closely.

“West, do not touch the rotten wood,” Devi chided. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

“Yes, Nellie, obviously.”

The room was very dark. It was sandwiched between the hall and Dawn’s room, so there were no porthole windows to let in the scant starlight that lit the rest of the house. But even in the dull glow of the camera’s light, it was clear that this room had been spared the years of rot and disrepair they had seen elsewhere in the mansion. The bed even looked freshly made, turned down, ready for an occupant to slip inside. There was a teddy bear on a pillow. But West could barely see any of this mundane backdrop beneath the layers of ghostly after images. Not spirits, there was no consciousness in these shades that lay as thick as the sludge that plagued the Bennington plumbing. They were barely memories. Just trauma that could not quite pass on, held in  Tara’s bedroom by… what? Usually trauma echoes were hitched to this reality by guilt. But there was no one left in the Bennington mansion to feel guilty, nothing to hold on to this lingering despair. 

Nellie was practically wading through them in her effort to explore the room and possibly steal the teddy bear, completely unaware of the distressed broken shapes she left in her wake. 

“You should get in the bed,” West whispered.

“I am not getting in the bed,” Nellie whispered back.

“Guys, please don’t whisper,” Devi sighed. “The mics won’t pick you up if you keep whispering.”

West flipped to Tara’s page in the guidebook, that showed an artistic picture of a girl who was more curls and ruffles than human being. 

“She looks pretty harmless,” West said, his eyes flicking to the shades that had congealed in the girl’s room. 

“Don’t trust appearances,” said Devi. “She was Bradford’s protégée in the dark arts. Apparently she was as skilled as him at communing with dark forces.”

“I believe it,” West said under his breath. 

“I wonder if she wanted that magic,” Nellie asked, surprisingly thoughtful. “Or if she resented the pressure of being Bradford’s favourite.”

West shared a look with Devi. They hadn’t said anything about favourites, but it felt true. 

“Well, maybe, maybe not,” said Devi. “After her siblings died and Bradford’s lovers abandoned him, Tara stayed, and took care of Bradford in his old age. She was supposedly at his side when he died, and then she fled. Disappeared. There were some rumors that she killed Bradford as revenge for her siblings’ misfortunes, or because of the evil magic he made her do. Or because she wanted to absorb his power.”

“Weird,” said West. Had the layer of shades gotten thicker as they spoke? Or wetter? Grosser? “We should go.”

“Wait,” said Devi, crouching to look at a little box on the ground, no bigger than a box for a ring, with nine sliding tiles on the top. “There’s some kind of puzzle here.”

“No, I see numbers, that counts as math,” Nellie protested. “We’re going to the next room.”

She pulled a pencil out of her bag.

“You are not going to write on a dead woman’s poem!” West protested.

“Some of the words are faded,” Nellie insisted. “I’m just going to write them in so they show up on camera.”

“How will you know what the right words are?” Devi asked.

“Well, the verses are haikus,” said Nellie. “And you can kind of see what the words should be. We’ll just make it fit the pattern. Here’s the first verse.”

It was dark, but he caught a glimpse of a shadowy ghost. She didn’t seem malevolent, but she did seem surprisingly distressed by their arrival. She hurried through the far wall, out of the library, clutching some illusion of a book close to her chest, her curls bouncing behind her until they disappeared through the moldy plaster wall. West eyed the cracks in the walls that unnerved him much more than the singular spectral presence. Could the building fall down on them? The fact that the ceiling was made of a strangely stained glass didn’t help. 

“Is that sludge or a choice?” West asked Devi.

Her eyes followed as he pointed his camera up, and she squinted at the shadowed material above them. West didn’t blame her. There weren’t any of the mansion’s signature porthole windows in this room, the only light dimly edging in from the hallway. He told himself he could see it better through the camera, but the hairs on the back of his neck knew that was a lie. The only ghost here might have left, but there was something paranormal about that glass, the sky it tried so hard to obscure… his fingertips tingled as he imagined the feel of that glass, how cool it would be, slick and foul.

Devi pulled a flashlight from her bag and panned across the uninviting room, illuminating bookshelves still filled with books that looked like they would tumble to the ground with one good knock on the strained wood. The black leather sofas that filled looked like low gravestones being swallowed by the earth. Or in this case, the hardwood floor. It looked pretty, but based on the state of the bookshelves, West wasn’t feeling too confident about exploring with the extra weight of their gear.

“The floor is lava,” Nellie whispered.

West chuckled, barely listening, his eyes flicking between the floor and the ceiling, trying to guess which was the bigger danger.  

Devi’s light caught on a large globe with a golden-hued frame and what looked like hand-painted countries, something West expected to see in a Victorian museum, not a 1970s mansion. There was a tapestry hanging on the wall, one corner hanging loose so it folded on itself, and he wasn’t sure if Devi even noticed how she avoided it, but West marked that it hung right above where the ghost had been reading. The light stopped at the far end of the room, where a similar archway led further into the mansion, bringing them closer to their final destination. Next to it, a solid black winding staircase led to an upper floor, there artificial material marking them as the least deteriorated thing in the room. 

“Well,” said Nellie. “There’s a lot going on here. I feel like library’s are made to be haunted. Lead the way West. But keep that camera on me.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1074" name="Library - West&#39;s Tour with Sludge" tags="" position="850,925" size="100,100">West guided Devi and Nellie through the hallway and under an ornate archway into the library. It was dark, but he caught a glimpse of a shadowy ghost. She didn’t seem malevolent, but she did seem surprisingly distressed by their arrival. She hurried through the far wall, out of the library, clutching some illusion of a book close to her chest, her curls bouncing behind her until they disappeared through the moldy plaster wall. West eyed the cracks in the walls that unnerved him much more than the singular spectral presence. Could the building fall down on them? The fact that the ceiling was made of a strangely stained glass didn’t help. 

“Is that sludge or a choice?” West asked Devi.

Her eyes followed as he pointed his camera up, and she squinted at the shadowed material above them. West didn’t blame her. There weren’t any of the mansion’s signature porthole windows in this room, the only light dimly edging in from the hallway. He told himself he could see it better through the camera, but the hairs on the back of his neck knew that was a lie. The only ghost here might have left, but there was something paranormal about that glass, the sky it tried so hard to obscure… his fingertips tingled as he imagined the feel of that glass, how cool it would be, slick and foul.

Devi pulled a flashlight from her bag and panned across the uninviting room, illuminating bookshelves still filled with books that looked like they would tumble to the ground with one good knock on the strained wood. The black leather sofas that filled looked like low gravestones being swallowed by the earth. Or in this case, the hardwood floor. It looked pretty, but based on the state of the bookshelves, West wasn’t feeling too confident about exploring with the extra weight of their gear.

“The floor is lava,” Nellie whispered.

West chuckled, barely listening, his eyes flicking between the floor and the ceiling, trying to guess which was the bigger danger.  

Devi’s light caught on a large globe with a golden-hued frame and what looked like hand-painted countries, something West expected to see in a Victorian museum, not a 1970s mansion. There was a tapestry hanging on the wall, one corner hanging loose so it folded on itself, and he wasn’t sure if Devi even noticed how she avoided it, but West marked that it hung right above where the ghost had been reading. The light stopped at the far end of the room, where a similar archway led further into the mansion, bringing them closer to their final destination. Next to it, a solid black winding staircase led to an upper floor, there artificial material marking them as the least deteriorated thing in the room. 

“Well,” said Nellie. “There’s a lot going on here. I feel like library’s are made to be haunted. Lead the way West. But keep that camera on me.”

West did as he was told.

“Ew, oh my god, oh my god,” said Nellie, peering over Devi’s shoulder.

“What is that?” asked West.

“Teeth,” said Devi.

There were two teeth, darkened with age, tapping together in the tiny box.

“My mom used to keep my baby teeth,” West said.

“These aren’t baby teeth,” said Devi.

They looked like adult molars. Why was there a puzzle box with two adult molars in Tara’s bedroom?

“This is why you don’t do math!” said Nellie, stomping out of the room. 

Devi closed the lid shut, leaving the teeth and the mystery behind her as she and West followed Nellie.

Nellie hopped up onto one of the sofas, almost completely lost her balance as it undulated under her like a waterbed, but managed to stay upright until it settled. She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. She stepped back, stumbling off the sofa, revealing the image on the tapestry. 

It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

A Satanic image.

A classic sign of evil.

Thank god. Fake shit like this was clickbait, and unlike the actual hauntings in the house, didn’t bother West at all. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns, and West dutifully caught the whole shot, including Nellie’s compelling expression of barely suppressed fear. “Do any of the Bennington’s have a ‘V’ name?”
“I can’t check the guidebook and film at the same time,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1148" name="Bookshelves - West&#39;s Tour" tags="" position="850,925" size="100,100">“No point of filming in a library if we don’t see books,” West said. 

He filmed Nellie, trying to look pensive as she stepped over to the books, frowning as she examined the spines. He was surprised when her performance of interested fell away as her jaw dropped, her eyes flickering with actual delight.

“Oh. My. God.”

“What is it?” asked Devi.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

They wouldn’t be for long if Nellie went tearing through them. As much as they appeared to be firmly glued together, based on the rot and sludge and crumbling state of the house, West could imagine their star opening the pages only to have them dissolve in her hands. She had already plucked on book from the shelf, and though she handled it carefully, West cleared his throat. She scowled at him.

“I’m being careful!” Nellie insisted. “I would never hurt Nancy.”

As he walked over to come up with an argument that didn’t make Nellie sound dangerously clumsy, the light from the camera caught on something tucked into the shadows of the shelf where the Nancy Drew book had once sat. West reached for the glittering object and pulled out an old locket. Simple. Cheap. Pretty. But looking at it made West’s stomach drop. He felt nauseous. He glanced around the room. Only angry ghosts made him feel like this, like he was on the edge of a dangerous fall. But he did not see any new specters. 

“It’s beautiful,” Nellie whispered.

She reached out for it and West stepped back, holding it close to his chest. He had to protect Nellie. He did not know where that thought came from, or what he was protecting her from by keeping the locket away from her, but he was sure that if she had it, something terrible would happen. 

“I’ll hold on to it,” he said, slipping it into his pocket.

“That’s stealing, West,” Devi scolded him. 

“I’m not going to keep it,” West said.

“Then we should put it back,” Nellie said, holding out her hand, like she would do just that.

But she wouldn’t. West stepped away again, pretending he was trying to get her in frame, but by the way her expression soured he knew she wasn’t buying it.

 “I’ll let the owner know that we found it tomorrow,” Devi said, her voice cutting through the tense silence. “Maybe it’s been lost for a while, or another crew left it here. It might have sentimental value.”
 
Nellie glared at Devi, but then she shrugged, wandering over to the sofas. 

“You should be filming me, West!” she shouted.

“You should put that in the hotel safe when we get back,” West whispered. “She’s totally going to try to steal it.”

He was relieved when Devi nodded slowly. He would feel more relieved when the locket wasn’t in his pocket, strangely heavy, strangely warm. 

“It’s getting late guys,” he said, making his voice a little tired, a little bored. “We can check out like, two more things, at an absolute maximum, and then keeping moving.”

Nellie shrugged, clearly only half-listening. West couldn’t read Devi’s expression but she didn’t fight him on it.

West flipped through the guidebook and saw a picture of that same telescope, the same arched glass ceiling, but the picture depicted a view of stars. Not real stars, a random spattering of six stars that weren’t even in the shape of a constellation. 

“Observatory,” he said, though both of his crewmates seemed lost in their thoughts, hardly listening. “Rather self-explanatory. Time to poke around.”

Nellie hopped up onto one of the sofas, almost completely lost her balance as it undulated under her like a waterbed, but managed to stay upright until it settled. She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. She stepped back, stumbling off the sofa, revealing the image on the tapestry. 

It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

A Satanic image.

A classic sign of evil.

Thank god. Fake shit like this was clickbait, and unlike the actual hauntings in the house, didn’t bother West at all. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns, and West dutifully caught the whole shot, including Nellie’s compelling expression of barely suppressed fear. “Do any of the Bennington’s have a ‘V’ name?”
“I can’t check the guidebook and film at the same time,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West.

He filmed Nellie, trying to look pensive as she stepped over to the books, frowning as she examined the spines. He was surprised when her performance of interested fell away as her jaw dropped, her eyes flickering with actual delight.

“Oh. My. God.”

“What is it?” asked Devi.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

They wouldn’t be for long if Nellie went tearing through them. As much as they appeared to be firmly glued together, based on the rot and sludge and crumbling state of the house, West could imagine their star opening the pages only to have them dissolve in her hands. She had already plucked on book from the shelf, and though she handled it carefully, West cleared his throat. She scowled at him.

“I’m being careful!” Nellie insisted. “I would never hurt Nancy.”

As he walked over to come up with an argument that didn’t make Nellie sound dangerously clumsy, the light from the camera caught on something tucked into the shadows of the shelf where the Nancy Drew book had once sat. West reached for the glittering object and pulled out an old locket. Simple. Cheap. Pretty. But looking at it made West’s stomach drop. He felt nauseous. He glanced around the room. Only angry ghosts made him feel like this, like he was on the edge of a dangerous fall. But he did not see any new specters. 

“It’s beautiful,” Nellie whispered.

She reached out for it and West stepped back, holding it close to his chest. He had to protect Nellie. He did not know where that thought came from, or what he was protecting her from by keeping the locket away from her, but he was sure that if she had it, something terrible would happen. 

“I’ll hold on to it,” he said, slipping it into his pocket.

“That’s stealing, West,” Devi scolded him. 

“I’m not going to keep it,” West said.

“Then we should put it back,” Nellie said, holding out her hand, like she would do just that.

But she wouldn’t. West stepped away again, pretending he was trying to get her in frame, but by the way her expression soured he knew she wasn’t buying it.

 “I’ll let the owner know that we found it tomorrow,” Devi said, her voice cutting through the tense silence. “Maybe it’s been lost for a while, or another crew left it here. It might have sentimental value.”
 
Nellie glared at Devi, but then she shrugged, wandering over to the sofas. 

“You should be filming me, West!” she shouted.

“You should put that in the hotel safe when we get back,” West whispered. “She’s totally going to try to steal it.”

He was relieved when Devi nodded slowly. He would feel more relieved when the locket wasn’t in his pocket, strangely heavy, strangely warm. 

“It’s getting late guys,” he said, making his voice a little tired, a little bored. “We can check out like, two more things, at an absolute maximum, and then keeping moving.”

Nellie shrugged, clearly only half-listening. West couldn’t read Devi’s expression but she didn’t fight him on it.

The boxy black beds were a similar style to the sofas below, but far less decayed. Perhaps being far from the malfunctioning plumbing helped. The little black side tables next to them seemed more artistic than useful – they didn’t even have drawers. No drawers, no closets.

Her expression shuddered, and West caught it perfectly. Even if she was putting it on a bit heavy, she was putting it on beautifully. 
“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

She turned away from the camera, scene complete. That was odd. Not like her to turn away from the spotlight. 

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

West grimaced. Maybe he was a little harsh. 

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? 

“Don’t, Devi,” said West. Both of his crewmates looked at him, confused for their own reasons. “It’s… old. Don’t want to break it, right?”

“Right,” said Devi, quickly dropping her outstretched hand.

Nellie threw West a grateful glance, and he shrugged. He didn’t need to know what Nellie saw. Maybe she was overreacting. But they might as well be safe. For Devi.

Spooktacular Investigations had done that a few times, but they never slept on fragile furniture, just sleeping bags on the ground. There was a chance the beds were made up to look like this, but West couldn’t imagine why. The wrinkled blankets were one thing. But that pillow… Was something stuffed into it? He reached out and squished it. 

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

West hardly listened to their protests, didn’t really know what he mumbled in explanation, because there was something in there, something hidden. His hands began to sweat and he put down the camera so he could shake the pillow case, free the secret object, a small box that fell to the ground - 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, grinning at his recent fear.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box. Just chocolate. Sweet chocolate. Truffles that had the lovely dark brown shine. 

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

They should have been. But they weren’t. West picked up one of the chocolates. Firm. Apparently fresh.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

But even as she spoke, the chocolate dissolved in his fingers, turning to mush. He gagged and dropped it, tossing the box on the bed. He could smell the awful scent of the rotten chocolate on his fingers, no matter how much he tried to wipe it off.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West.

He turned the camera back to the glass. It would be good B-roll. 

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said.

West turned back to see Nellie holding a spiral notebook, the kind he used in middle school for his classwork.  

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary. West knelt on the ground with a feeling of dread, searching for what had fallen, but the floor was in rougher shape than he realized, full of cracks and holes. He thought he saw a glint of something in one of the cracks, but just slightly too far down for him to pinch it and pull it out. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West, abandoning the lost object to the floor.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

“I’ll hold on to it,” said West.

“You don’t even have a bag,” Nellie protested.

“I have pockets,” West said. 

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over. 

“What is wrong with both of you?” Devi shouted, making both West and Nellie jump. “We’re not investigating, we’re… we’re looting!”

She stomped down the stairs, leaving West and Nellie to glance guiltily at each other.

“Maybe you should just pick one of those to take with us,” she suggested before hastily following Devi.

They should have been. But they weren’t. West picked up one of the chocolates. Firm. Apparently fresh.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

“Blegh,” said West, putting the chocolate back in its box. 

He placed the pillow on the bed, couldn’t fit the box back in the pillowcase, and decided to set the box at the foot of the bed.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

&quot;That&#39;s all we have time for here,&quot; West reminded her. 

&quot;Then lead us onwards, leader,&quot; Nellie grinned, gesturing to the door.

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West.

He turned the camera back to the glass. It would be good B-roll. 

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said.

West turned back to see Nellie holding a spiral notebook, the kind he used in middle school for his classwork.  

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary. West knelt on the ground with a feeling of dread, searching for what had fallen, but the floor was in rougher shape than he realized, full of cracks and holes. He thought he saw a glint of something in one of the cracks, but just slightly too far down for him to pinch it and pull it out. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West, abandoning the lost object to the floor.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

“I’ll hold on to it,” said West.

“You don’t even have a bag,” Nellie protested.

“I have pockets,” West said. 

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over. 

“What is wrong with both of you?” Devi shouted, making both West and Nellie jump. “We’re not investigating, we’re… we’re looting!”

She stomped down the stairs, leaving West and Nellie to glance guiltily at each other.

“Maybe you should just pick one of those to take with us,” she suggested before hastily following Devi.

Spooktacular Investigations had done that a few times, but they never slept on fragile furniture, just sleeping bags on the ground. There was a chance the beds were made up to look like this, but West couldn’t imagine why. The wrinkled blankets were one thing. But that pillow… Was something stuffed into it? He reached out and squished it. 

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

West hardly listened to their protests, didn’t really know what he mumbled in explanation, because there was something in there, something hidden. His hands began to sweat and he put down the camera so he could shake the pillow case, free the secret object, a small box that fell to the ground - 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, grinning at his recent fear.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box. Just chocolate. Sweet chocolate. Truffles that had the lovely dark brown shine.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

But even as she spoke, the chocolate dissolved in his fingers, turning to mush. He gagged and dropped it, tossing the box on the bed. He could smell the awful scent of the rotten chocolate on his fingers, no matter how much he tried to wipe it off.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

There were ghosts here, more ghosts than he had seen anywhere else in the mansion, but not lazing about, retracing their steps, or trying to communicate like any normal spectres he had encountered. They were pressed together in a tight mass along a wall that was covered in mutilated pictures. West could not tell if the spirits were likewise mutilated, they melded together to deeply to distinguish actual features. Bile rose hot on his tongue as he watched Nellie saunter over and trace the cuts in the pictures with her fingertips, reaching through those spectral limbs, spider like in their writhing mass. Were they pressed there on purpose, or trapped? He could not tell. They did not look like they were trying to escape, though a few eyes roved over Nellie’s body, some free fingers caressed her cheek and she did not even flinch. 

“Does anyone see a knife?” asked Nellie.

Devi was sitting on a hospital bed opposite the picture wall, not quite what West was expecting as mansion furniture, but it was probably necessary at the end of the Bradford’s life. He wondered if Bradford’s failing health had anything to do with the horror show Nellie kept gliding through. 

West wandered over to a wardrobe in the corner, intricate and gothic, as an excuse to get away from the spirits that were starting to reach for him too, all globular sinking eyes and interwoven limbs. He flipped through the guidebook as an excuse to ignore them, to deny their offer of contact. But there was no chapter for “Bradford’s Bedroom.” Not even a picture.

“There’s nothing for this room,” West said. 

“Bradford was alive when the tours were happening, but he would stay shut in his room,” said Devi from her perch. “No one was allowed to see him or come here. Besides, this was his private space.”

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“I think there are some castle tours in Scotland like that,” said Devi.

“Haunted ones?” West asked, perking up. Yes, he was planning on leaving, but he wasn’t crazy about the idea of his final shift including the wall creature from another dimension. A big overseas blow-out would be a much better farewell. “We should do a trip. Claim it as a business expense.”

“Sure, West, I’ll bet the IRS will love that for us,” Nellie groaned.

“We’ll go to the garden next,” Devi said, gesturing to the door on the far wall that was luckily ghost-free. “We have to cross it to get to the Gallery. And we might see the ghost of Bradford’s son, Mark. If Bradford killed him, amateur sleuths think that’s where he was probably buried. But no body was found so… probably not.”

“It could have been eaten by worms,” Nellie suggested.

“I don’t think worms work that fast,” West countered. “Unless they’re like, ‘Dune’ worms.”

Unless he was eaten by something else. Partially chewed up. Regurgitated back into the bedroom. 

West leaned against the wardrobe, wincing as he heard a snapping creak that, oddly enough, seemed to create an echo. Devi shifted nervously on the hospital bed, her hand clearly covering up something she found. 

“Anything interesting to explore or should we take this party outside?” Nellie asked, flashing a grin.

“Haunted ones?” West asked, perking up. Yes, he was planning on leaving, but he wasn’t crazy about the idea of his final shift including the wall creature from another dimension. A big overseas blow-out would be a much better farewell. “We should do a trip. Claim it as a business expense.”

“Sure, West, I’ll bet the IRS will love that for us,” Nellie groaned.

“We’ll go to the garden next,” Devi said, gesturing to the door on the far wall that was luckily ghost-free. “We have to cross it to get to the Gallery. And we might see the ghost of Bradford’s son, Mark. If Bradford killed him, amateur sleuths think that’s where he was probably buried. But no body was found so… probably not.”

“It could have been eaten by worms,” Nellie suggested.

“I don’t think worms work that fast,” West countered. “Unless they’re like, ‘Dune’ worms.”

Unless he was eaten by something else. Partially chewed up. Regurgitated back into the bedroom. 

West leaned against the wardrobe, wincing as he heard a snapping creak that, oddly enough, seemed to create an echo. Devi shifted nervously on the hospital bed, her hand clearly covering up something she found. 

“Anything interesting to explore or should we take this party outside?” Nellie asked, flashing a grin.

There were ghosts here, more ghosts than he had seen anywhere else in the mansion, but not lazing about, retracing their steps, or trying to communicate like any normal spectres he had encountered. They were pressed together in a tight mass along a wall that was covered in mutilated pictures. West could not tell if the spirits were likewise mutilated, they melded together to deeply to distinguish actual features. Bile rose hot on his tongue as he watched Nellie saunter over and trace the cuts in the pictures with her fingertips, reaching through those spectral limbs, spider like in their writhing mass. Were they pressed there on purpose, or trapped? He could not tell. They did not look like they were trying to escape, though a few eyes roved over Nellie’s body, some free fingers caressed her cheek and she did not even flinch. 

“Does anyone see a knife?” asked Nellie.

Devi was sitting on a hospital bed opposite the picture wall, not quite what West was expecting as mansion furniture, but it was probably necessary at the end of the Bradford’s life. He wondered if Bradford’s failing health had anything to do with the horror show Nellie kept gliding through. 

West wandered over to a wardrobe in the corner, intricate and gothic, as an excuse to get away from the spirits that were starting to reach for him too, all globular sinking eyes and interwoven limbs. He flipped through the guidebook as an excuse to ignore them, to deny their offer of contact. But there was no chapter for “Bradford’s Bedroom.” Not even a picture.

“There’s nothing for this room,” West said. 

“Bradford was alive when the tours were happening, but he would stay shut in his room,” said Devi from her perch. “No one was allowed to see him or come here. Besides, this was his private space.”

“Is that normal?” West asked. “To have tours in a place where someone is actively living?”

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

She turned away from the camera, scene complete. That was odd. Not like her to turn away from the spotlight. 

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

West grimaced. Maybe he was a little harsh. 

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? 

“Don’t, Devi,” said West. Both of his crewmates looked at him, confused for their own reasons. “It’s… old. Don’t want to break it, right? And we&#39;re out of time here, anyway.”

“Right,” said Devi, quickly dropping her outstretched hand.

Nellie threw West a grateful glance, and he shrugged. He didn’t need to know what Nellie saw. Maybe she was overreacting. But they might as well be safe. For Devi.

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West.

He turned the camera back to the glass. It would be good B-roll. 

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said.

West turned back to see Nellie holding a spiral notebook, the kind he used in middle school for his classwork.  

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary. West knelt on the ground with a feeling of dread, searching for what had fallen, but the floor was in rougher shape than he realized, full of cracks and holes. He thought he saw a glint of something in one of the cracks, but just slightly too far down for him to pinch it and pull it out. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West, abandoning the lost object to the floor.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

“I’ll hold on to it,” said West.

“You don’t even have a bag,” Nellie protested.

“I have pockets,” West said. 

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over. 

“What is wrong with both of you?” Devi shouted, making both West and Nellie jump. “We’re not investigating, we’re… we’re looting!”

She stomped down the stairs, leaving West and Nellie to glance guiltily at each other.

“Maybe you should just pick one of those to take with us,” she suggested before hastily following Devi.

Spooktacular Investigations had done that a few times, but they never slept on fragile furniture, just sleeping bags on the ground. There was a chance the beds were made up to look like this, but West couldn’t imagine why. The wrinkled blankets were one thing. But that pillow… Was something stuffed into it? He reached out and squished it. 

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

West hardly listened to their protests, didn’t really know what he mumbled in explanation, because there was something in there, something hidden. His hands began to sweat and he put down the camera so he could shake the pillow case, free the secret object, a small box that fell to the ground - 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, grinning at his recent fear.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box. Just chocolate. Sweet chocolate. Truffles that had the lovely dark brown shine. 

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

They should have been. But they weren’t. West picked up one of the chocolates. Firm. Apparently fresh.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

“Blegh,” said West, putting the chocolate back in its box. 

He placed the pillow on the bed, couldn’t fit the box back in the pillowcase, and decided to set the box at the foot of the bed.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

West turned back to see Nellie holding a spiral notebook, the kind he used in middle school for his classwork.  

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary. West knelt on the ground with a feeling of dread, searching for what had fallen, but the floor was in rougher shape than he realized, full of cracks and holes. He thought he saw a glint of something in one of the cracks, but just slightly too far down for him to pinch it and pull it out. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West, abandoning the lost object to the floor.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

“I’ll hold on to it,” said West.

“You don’t even have a bag,” Nellie protested.

“I have pockets,” West said. 

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over. 

West saw Devi almost protest as he slipped the book into his pocket, then change her mind.

Spooktacular Investigations had done that a few times, but they never slept on fragile furniture, just sleeping bags on the ground. There was a chance the beds were made up to look like this, but West couldn’t imagine why. The wrinkled blankets were one thing. But that pillow… Was something stuffed into it? He reached out and squished it. 

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

West hardly listened to their protests, didn’t really know what he mumbled in explanation, because there was something in there, something hidden. His hands began to sweat and he put down the camera so he could shake the pillow case, free the secret object, a small box that fell to the ground - 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, grinning at his recent fear.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box. Just chocolate. Sweet chocolate. Truffles that had the lovely dark brown shine. 

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

They should have been. But they weren’t. West picked up one of the chocolates. Firm. Apparently fresh.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

“Blegh,” said West, putting the chocolate back in its box. 

He placed the pillow on the bed, couldn’t fit the box back in the pillowcase, and decided to set the box at the foot of the bed.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

“Don’t, Devi,” said West. Both of his crewmates looked at him, confused for their own reasons. “It’s… old. Don’t want to break it, right?”

“Right,” said Devi, quickly dropping her outstretched hand.

Nellie threw West a grateful glance, and he shrugged. He didn’t need to know what Nellie saw. Maybe she was overreacting. But they might as well be safe. For Devi.

Nellie hopped up onto one of the sofas, almost completely lost her balance as it undulated under her like a waterbed, but managed to stay upright until it settled. She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. She stepped back, stumbling off the sofa, revealing the image on the tapestry. 

It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

A Satanic image.

A classic sign of evil.

Thank god. Fake shit like this was clickbait, and unlike the actual hauntings in the house, didn’t bother West at all. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns, and West dutifully caught the whole shot, including Nellie’s compelling expression of barely suppressed fear. “Do any of the Bennington’s have a ‘V’ name?”

“I can’t check the guidebook and film at the same time,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West.

He filmed Nellie, trying to look pensive as she stepped over to the books, frowning as she examined the spines. He was surprised when her performance of interested fell away as her jaw dropped, her eyes flickering with actual delight.

“Oh. My. God.”

“What is it?” asked Devi.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

They wouldn’t be for long if Nellie went tearing through them. As much as they appeared to be firmly glued together, based on the rot and sludge and crumbling state of the house, West could imagine their star opening the pages only to have them dissolve in her hands. She had already plucked on book from the shelf, and though she handled it carefully, West cleared his throat. She scowled at him.

“I’m being careful!” Nellie insisted. “I would never hurt Nancy.”

As he walked over to come up with an argument that didn’t make Nellie sound dangerously clumsy, the light from the camera caught on something tucked into the shadows of the shelf where the Nancy Drew book had once sat. West reached for the glittering object and pulled out an old locket. Simple. Cheap. Pretty. But looking at it made West’s stomach drop. He felt nauseous. He glanced around the room. Only angry ghosts made him feel like this, like he was on the edge of a dangerous fall. But he did not see any new specters. 

“It’s beautiful,” Nellie whispered.

She reached out for it and West stepped back, holding it close to his chest. He had to protect Nellie. He did not know where that thought came from, or what he was protecting her from by keeping the locket away from her, but he was sure that if she had it, something terrible would happen. 

“I’ll hold on to it,” he said, slipping it into his pocket.

“What is wrong with both of you?” Devi shouted, making both West and Nellie jump. “We’re not investigating, we’re… we’re looting!”

She stomped away, leaving West and Nellie to glance guiltily at each other.

“Maybe you should just pick one of those to take with us,” she suggested before hastily following Devi.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box. Just chocolate. Sweet chocolate. Truffles that had the lovely dark brown shine. 

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

They should have been. But they weren’t. West picked up one of the chocolates. Firm. Apparently fresh.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

But even as she spoke, the chocolate dissolved in his fingers, turning to mush. He gagged and dropped it, tossing the box on the bed. He could smell the awful scent of the rotten chocolate on his fingers, no matter how much he tried to wipe it off.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West.

He turned the camera back to the glass. It would be good B-roll. 

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said.

West turned back to see Nellie holding a spiral notebook, the kind he used in middle school for his classwork.  

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary. West knelt on the ground with a feeling of dread, searching for what had fallen, but the floor was in rougher shape than he realized, full of cracks and holes. He thought he saw a glint of something in one of the cracks, but just slightly too far down for him to pinch it and pull it out. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West, abandoning the lost object to the floor.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

“I’ll hold on to it,” said West.

“You don’t even have a bag,” Nellie protested.

“I have pockets,” West said. 

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over. 

West saw Devi almost protest as he slipped the book into his pocket, then change her mind.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

She turned away from the camera, scene complete. That was odd. Not like her to turn away from the spotlight. 

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

West grimaced. Maybe he was a little harsh. 

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? 

“Don’t, Devi,” said West. Both of his crewmates looked at him, confused for their own reasons. “It’s… old. Don’t want to break it, right?”

“Right,” said Devi, quickly dropping her outstretched hand.

Nellie threw West a grateful glance, and he shrugged. He didn’t need to know what Nellie saw. Maybe she was overreacting. But they might as well be safe. For Devi.

Nellie hopped up onto one of the sofas, almost completely lost her balance as it undulated under her like a waterbed, but managed to stay upright until it settled. She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. She stepped back, stumbling off the sofa, revealing the image on the tapestry. 

It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

A Satanic image.

A classic sign of evil.

Thank god. Fake shit like this was clickbait, and unlike the actual hauntings in the house, didn’t bother West at all. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns, and West dutifully caught the whole shot, including Nellie’s compelling expression of barely suppressed fear. “Do any of the Bennington’s have a ‘V’ name?”

“I can’t check the guidebook and film at the same time,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1238" name="Bookshelves - West&#39;s Tour with Sludge (with Diary)" tags="" position="850,925" size="100,100">“No point of filming in a library if we don’t see books,” West said. 

He filmed Nellie, trying to look pensive as she stepped over to the books, frowning as she examined the spines. He was surprised when her performance of interested fell away as her jaw dropped, her eyes flickering with actual delight.

“Oh. My. God.”

“What is it?” asked Devi.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

They wouldn’t be for long if Nellie went tearing through them. As much as they appeared to be firmly glued together, based on the rot and sludge and crumbling state of the house, West could imagine their star opening the pages only to have them dissolve in her hands. She had already plucked on book from the shelf, and though she handled it carefully, West cleared his throat. She scowled at him.

“I’m being careful!” Nellie insisted. “I would never hurt Nancy.”

As he walked over to come up with an argument that didn’t make Nellie sound dangerously clumsy, the light from the camera caught on something tucked into the shadows of the shelf where the Nancy Drew book had once sat. West reached for the glittering object and pulled out an old locket. Simple. Cheap. Pretty. But looking at it made West’s stomach drop. He felt nauseous. He glanced around the room. Only angry ghosts made him feel like this, like he was on the edge of a dangerous fall. But he did not see any new specters. 

“It’s beautiful,” Nellie whispered.

She reached out for it and West stepped back, holding it close to his chest. He had to protect Nellie. He did not know where that thought came from, or what he was protecting her from by keeping the locket away from her, but he was sure that if she had it, something terrible would happen. 

“I’ll hold on to it,” he said, slipping it into his pocket.

“What is wrong with both of you?” Devi shouted, making both West and Nellie jump. “We’re not investigating, we’re… we’re looting!”

She stomped away, leaving West and Nellie to glance guiltily at each other.

“Maybe you should just pick one of those to take with us,” she suggested before hastily following Devi.

West turned back to see Nellie holding a spiral notebook, the kind he used in middle school for his classwork.  

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary. West knelt on the ground with a feeling of dread, searching for what had fallen, but the floor was in rougher shape than he realized, full of cracks and holes. He thought he saw a glint of something in one of the cracks, but just slightly too far down for him to pinch it and pull it out. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West, abandoning the lost object to the floor.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

“I’ll hold on to it,” said West.

“You don’t even have a bag,” Nellie protested.

“I have pockets,” West said. 

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over. 

West saw Devi almost protest as he slipped the book into his pocket, then change her mind.

Spooktacular Investigations had done that a few times, but they never slept on fragile furniture, just sleeping bags on the ground. There was a chance the beds were made up to look like this, but West couldn’t imagine why. The wrinkled blankets were one thing. But that pillow… Was something stuffed into it? He reached out and squished it. 

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

West hardly listened to their protests, didn’t really know what he mumbled in explanation, because there was something in there, something hidden. His hands began to sweat and he put down the camera so he could shake the pillow case, free the secret object, a small box that fell to the ground - 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, grinning at his recent fear.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box. Just chocolate. Sweet chocolate. Truffles that had the lovely dark brown shine. 

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

They should have been. But they weren’t. West picked up one of the chocolates. Firm. Apparently fresh.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

“Blegh,” said West, putting the chocolate back in its box. 

He placed the pillow on the bed, couldn’t fit the box back in the pillowcase, and decided to set the box at the foot of the bed.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

Her expression shuddered, and West caught it perfectly. Even if she was putting it on a bit heavy, she was putting it on beautifully. 

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

She turned away from the camera, scene complete. That was odd. Not like her to turn away from the spotlight. 

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

West grimaced. Maybe he was a little harsh. 

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? 

“Don’t, Devi,” said West. Both of his crewmates looked at him, confused for their own reasons. “It’s… old. Don’t want to break it, right?”

“Right,” said Devi, quickly dropping her outstretched hand.

Nellie threw West a grateful glance, and he shrugged. He didn’t need to know what Nellie saw. Maybe she was overreacting. But they might as well be safe. For Devi.

Nellie hopped up onto one of the sofas, almost completely lost her balance as it undulated under her like a waterbed, but managed to stay upright until it settled. She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. She stepped back, stumbling off the sofa, revealing the image on the tapestry. 

It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

A Satanic image.

A classic sign of evil.

Thank god. Fake shit like this was clickbait, and unlike the actual hauntings in the house, didn’t bother West at all. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns, and West dutifully caught the whole shot, including Nellie’s compelling expression of barely suppressed fear. “Do any of the Bennington’s have a ‘V’ name?”

“I can’t check the guidebook and film at the same time,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West. 

[[Bradford&#39;s Bedroom - West&#39;s Tour with Pick (with Diary)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1253" name="Bookshelves - West&#39;s Tour with Pick (with Diary)" tags="" position="850,925" size="100,100">“No point of filming in a library if we don’t see books,” West said. 

He filmed Nellie, trying to look pensive as she stepped over to the books, frowning as she examined the spines. He was surprised when her performance of interested fell away as her jaw dropped, her eyes flickering with actual delight.

“Oh. My. God.”

“What is it?” asked Devi.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

They wouldn’t be for long if Nellie went tearing through them. As much as they appeared to be firmly glued together, based on the rot and sludge and crumbling state of the house, West could imagine their star opening the pages only to have them dissolve in her hands. She had already plucked on book from the shelf, and though she handled it carefully, West cleared his throat. She scowled at him.

“I’m being careful!” Nellie insisted. “I would never hurt Nancy.”

As he walked over to come up with an argument that didn’t make Nellie sound dangerously clumsy, the light from the camera caught on something tucked into the shadows of the shelf where the Nancy Drew book had once sat. West reached for the glittering object and pulled out an old locket. Simple. Cheap. Pretty. But looking at it made West’s stomach drop. He felt nauseous. He glanced around the room. Only angry ghosts made him feel like this, like he was on the edge of a dangerous fall. But he did not see any new specters. 

“It’s beautiful,” Nellie whispered.

She reached out for it and West stepped back, holding it close to his chest. He had to protect Nellie. He did not know where that thought came from, or what he was protecting her from by keeping the locket away from her, but he was sure that if she had it, something terrible would happen. 

“I’ll hold on to it,” he said, slipping it into his pocket.

“What is wrong with both of you?” Devi shouted, making both West and Nellie jump. “We’re not investigating, we’re… we’re looting!”

She stomped away, leaving West and Nellie to glance guiltily at each other.

“Maybe you should just pick one of those to take with us,” she suggested before hastily following Devi.

He thought he saw a glint of something in one of the cracks, but just slightly too far down for him to pinch it and pull it out. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West, abandoning the lost object to the floor.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

“I’ll hold on to it,” said West.

“You don’t even have a bag,” Nellie protested.

“I have pockets,” West said. 

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over. 

West saw Devi almost protest as he slipped the book into his pocket, then change her mind.

Her expression shuddered, and West caught it perfectly. Even if she was putting it on a bit heavy, she was putting it on beautifully. 

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

She turned away from the camera, scene complete. That was odd. Not like her to turn away from the spotlight. 

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

West grimaced. Maybe he was a little harsh. 

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? 

“Don’t, Devi,” said West. Both of his crewmates looked at him, confused for their own reasons. “It’s… old. Don’t want to break it, right?”

“Right,” said Devi, quickly dropping her outstretched hand.

Nellie threw West a grateful glance, and he shrugged. He didn’t need to know what Nellie saw. Maybe she was overreacting. But they might as well be safe. For Devi.

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West.

He turned the camera back to the glass. It would be good B-roll. 

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said.

West turned back to see Nellie holding a spiral notebook, the kind he used in middle school for his classwork.  

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Spooktacular Investigations had done that a few times, but they never slept on fragile furniture, just sleeping bags on the ground. There was a chance the beds were made up to look like this, but West couldn’t imagine why. The wrinkled blankets were one thing. But that pillow… Was something stuffed into it? He reached out and squished it. 

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

West hardly listened to their protests, didn’t really know what he mumbled in explanation, because there was something in there, something hidden. His hands began to sweat and he put down the camera so he could shake the pillow case, free the secret object, a small box that fell to the ground - 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, grinning at his recent fear.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box. Just chocolate. Sweet chocolate. Truffles that had the lovely dark brown shine. 

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

They should have been. But they weren’t. West picked up one of the chocolates. Firm. Apparently fresh.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

But even as she spoke, the chocolate dissolved in his fingers, turning to mush. He gagged and dropped it, tossing the box on the bed. He could smell the awful scent of the rotten chocolate on his fingers, no matter how much he tried to wipe it off.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

Nellie hopped up onto one of the sofas, almost completely lost her balance as it undulated under her like a waterbed, but managed to stay upright until it settled. She grabbed the edge of the tapestry, pressed up onto her toes and secured the corner back onto a rusted nail. She stepped back, stumbling off the sofa, revealing the image on the tapestry. 

It was the head of a goat, not depicted artistically floating in some empty black space, but dripping bloody gore from its torn-up throat. Its two horns were too large, extending high over its head in a large V, curving gently at the top.

A Satanic image.

A classic sign of evil.

Thank god. Fake shit like this was clickbait, and unlike the actual hauntings in the house, didn’t bother West at all. 

“Nice,” said West. “We needed some occult stuff.”

“I could have done with just the spooky vibes,” said Devi.

“I think it is a V…” Nellie whispered to herself.

“No whispering!” shouted Devi.

“I think the horns are supposed to depict a V,” Nellie repeated, gesturing up at the horns, and West dutifully caught the whole shot, including Nellie’s compelling expression of barely suppressed fear. “Do any of the Bennington’s have a ‘V’ name?”

“I can’t check the guidebook and film at the same time,” said West.

“They don’t,” said Devi. “I mean, we don’t know any of Bradford’s lovers’ names. So maybe, actually?”

“Very helpful, Devi,” sighed Nellie.

“Still a cool tapestry,” said West. 

[[Bradford&#39;s Bedroom - West&#39;s Tour with Sludge and Pick (with Diary)]]

He filmed Nellie, trying to look pensive as she stepped over to the books, frowning as she examined the spines. He was surprised when her performance of interested fell away as her jaw dropped, her eyes flickering with actual delight.

“Oh. My. God.”

“What is it?” asked Devi.

“It’s a first edition collection of the Nancy Drew series!” Nellie squealed, running her fingers along the cloth binding. “They’re still in pretty good condition, too!”

They wouldn’t be for long if Nellie went tearing through them. As much as they appeared to be firmly glued together, based on the rot and sludge and crumbling state of the house, West could imagine their star opening the pages only to have them dissolve in her hands. She had already plucked on book from the shelf, and though she handled it carefully, West cleared his throat. She scowled at him.

“I’m being careful!” Nellie insisted. “I would never hurt Nancy.”

As he walked over to come up with an argument that didn’t make Nellie sound dangerously clumsy, the light from the camera caught on something tucked into the shadows of the shelf where the Nancy Drew book had once sat. West reached for the glittering object and pulled out an old locket. Simple. Cheap. Pretty. But looking at it made West’s stomach drop. He felt nauseous. He glanced around the room. Only angry ghosts made him feel like this, like he was on the edge of a dangerous fall. But he did not see any new specters. 

“It’s beautiful,” Nellie whispered.

She reached out for it and West stepped back, holding it close to his chest. He had to protect Nellie. He did not know where that thought came from, or what he was protecting her from by keeping the locket away from her, but he was sure that if she had it, something terrible would happen. 

“I’ll hold on to it,” he said, slipping it into his pocket.

“What is wrong with both of you?” Devi shouted, making both West and Nellie jump. “We’re not investigating, we’re… we’re looting!”

She stomped away, leaving West and Nellie to glance guiltily at each other.

“Maybe you should just pick one of those to take with us,” she suggested before hastily following Devi.

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over. 

West saw Devi almost protest as he slipped the book into his pocket, then change her mind.

Her expression shuddered, and West caught it perfectly. Even if she was putting it on a bit heavy, she was putting it on beautifully. 

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

She turned away from the camera, scene complete. That was odd. Not like her to turn away from the spotlight. 

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

West grimaced. Maybe he was a little harsh. 

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? 

“Don’t, Devi,” said West. Both of his crewmates looked at him, confused for their own reasons. “It’s… old. Don’t want to break it, right?”

“Right,” said Devi, quickly dropping her outstretched hand.

Nellie threw West a grateful glance, and he shrugged. He didn’t need to know what Nellie saw. Maybe she was overreacting. But they might as well be safe. For Devi.

Spooktacular Investigations had done that a few times, but they never slept on fragile furniture, just sleeping bags on the ground. There was a chance the beds were made up to look like this, but West couldn’t imagine why. The wrinkled blankets were one thing. But that pillow… Was something stuffed into it? He reached out and squished it. 

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

West hardly listened to their protests, didn’t really know what he mumbled in explanation, because there was something in there, something hidden. His hands began to sweat and he put down the camera so he could shake the pillow case, free the secret object, a small box that fell to the ground - 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, grinning at his recent fear.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box. Just chocolate. Sweet chocolate. Truffles that had the lovely dark brown shine. 

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

They should have been. But they weren’t. West picked up one of the chocolates. Firm. Apparently fresh.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

“Blegh,” said West, putting the chocolate back in its box. 

He placed the pillow on the bed, couldn’t fit the box back in the pillowcase, and decided to set the box at the foot of the bed.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West.

He turned the camera back to the glass. It would be good B-roll. 

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said.

West turned back to see Nellie holding a spiral notebook, the kind he used in middle school for his classwork.  

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary. West knelt on the ground with a feeling of dread, searching for what had fallen, but the floor was in rougher shape than he realized, full of cracks and holes. He thought he saw a glint of something in one of the cracks, but just slightly too far down for him to pinch it and pull it out. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West, abandoning the lost object to the floor.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

“I’ll hold on to it,” said West.

“You don’t even have a bag,” Nellie protested.

“I have pockets,” West said. 

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over.

Her expression shuddered, and West caught it perfectly. Even if she was putting it on a bit heavy, she was putting it on beautifully. 

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

She turned away from the camera, scene complete. That was odd. Not like her to turn away from the spotlight. 

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

West grimaced. Maybe he was a little harsh. 

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? 

“Don’t, Devi,” said West. Both of his crewmates looked at him, confused for their own reasons. “It’s… old. Don’t want to break it, right?”

“Right,” said Devi, quickly dropping her outstretched hand.

Nellie threw West a grateful glance, and he shrugged. He didn’t need to know what Nellie saw. Maybe she was overreacting. But they might as well be safe. For Devi.

Spooktacular Investigations had done that a few times, but they never slept on fragile furniture, just sleeping bags on the ground. There was a chance the beds were made up to look like this, but West couldn’t imagine why. The wrinkled blankets were one thing. But that pillow… Was something stuffed into it? He reached out and squished it. 

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

West hardly listened to their protests, didn’t really know what he mumbled in explanation, because there was something in there, something hidden. His hands began to sweat and he put down the camera so he could shake the pillow case, free the secret object, a small box that fell to the ground - 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, grinning at his recent fear.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box. Just chocolate. Sweet chocolate. Truffles that had the lovely dark brown shine. 

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

They should have been. But they weren’t. West picked up one of the chocolates. Firm. Apparently fresh.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

But even as she spoke, the chocolate dissolved in his fingers, turning to mush. He gagged and dropped it, tossing the box on the bed. He could smell the awful scent of the rotten chocolate on his fingers, no matter how much he tried to wipe it off.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West.

He turned the camera back to the glass. It would be good B-roll. 

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said.

West turned back to see Nellie holding a spiral notebook, the kind he used in middle school for his classwork.  

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary. West knelt on the ground with a feeling of dread, searching for what had fallen, but the floor was in rougher shape than he realized, full of cracks and holes. He thought he saw a glint of something in one of the cracks, but just slightly too far down for him to pinch it and pull it out. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West, abandoning the lost object to the floor.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

“I’ll hold on to it,” said West.

“You don’t even have a bag,” Nellie protested.

“I have pockets,” West said. 

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over. 

West saw Devi almost protest as he slipped the book into his pocket, then change her mind.

“It’s a mod side table,” said Devi.

“Mod?” 

“Modern?” Devi continued. “Like, mid-century, fashion. 60s-70s style. I might be making this up.”

“Well, it doesn’t have a drawer or anything on it,” said West.

He turned the camera back to the glass. It would be good B-roll. 

“There’s a book behind it,” Nellie said.

West turned back to see Nellie holding a spiral notebook, the kind he used in middle school for his classwork.  

“You should put that back,” Devi said quietly. “It looks private.”

“Oh yeah, it’s definitely someone’s diary,” Nellie agreed, opening it. “Oops.”

Something slipped out of the diary. West knelt on the ground with a feeling of dread, searching for what had fallen, but the floor was in rougher shape than he realized, full of cracks and holes. He thought he saw a glint of something in one of the cracks, but just slightly too far down for him to pinch it and pull it out. 

“Seriously, Nellie?” Devi said, exasperated. 

“It’s not like anyone’s going to miss it, whatever it is,” Nellie shrugged. “And it was totally worth it.”

She opened the book and showed it off for the camera: large, looping letters that were barely decipherable, except one deeply imprinted “I HATE THEM,” another that might have been a scrawled “cursed ground,” and a heavily stylized, horn-like V.

“Well, that’s interesting,” said West, abandoning the lost object to the floor.

“That’s one word for it,” Nellie laughed. She snapped the book shut. “We can get a better look at it late. Scan the pages at home.”

“I’ll hold on to it,” said West.

“You don’t even have a bag,” Nellie protested.

“I have pockets,” West said. 

“Ugh, I always forget how big the pockets are in men’s clothes,” said Nellie, reluctantly handing it over. 

West saw Devi almost protest as he slipped the book into his pocket, then change her mind.

Her expression shuddered, and West caught it perfectly. Even if she was putting it on a bit heavy, she was putting it on beautifully. 

“What do you see?” asked Devi.

“Nothing,” said Nellie.

She turned away from the camera, scene complete. That was odd. Not like her to turn away from the spotlight. 

“What do you mean?” asked West. 

“I… I don’t like it here. Let’s go.”

&quot;We&#39;ve barely started looking around,&quot; said West. &quot;Plus, you look good all freaked out on camera like this.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the worst compliment,&quot; said Nellie.

West grimaced. Maybe he was a little harsh. 

“Let me see,” said Devi.

She saw Nellie bite her lip, holding back… a warning? 

“Don’t, Devi,” said West. Both of his crewmates looked at him, confused for their own reasons. “It’s… old. Don’t want to break it, right?”

“Right,” said Devi, quickly dropping her outstretched hand.

Nellie threw West a grateful glance, and he shrugged. He didn’t need to know what Nellie saw. Maybe she was overreacting. But they might as well be safe. For Devi.

Spooktacular Investigations had done that a few times, but they never slept on fragile furniture, just sleeping bags on the ground. There was a chance the beds were made up to look like this, but West couldn’t imagine why. The wrinkled blankets were one thing. But that pillow… Was something stuffed into it? He reached out and squished it. 

“West, don’t touch those!” Devi gasped as Nellie laughed.

West hardly listened to their protests, didn’t really know what he mumbled in explanation, because there was something in there, something hidden. His hands began to sweat and he put down the camera so he could shake the pillow case, free the secret object, a small box that fell to the ground - 

“Chocolates!” West said, grabbing it, grinning at his recent fear.

Nellie fake gagged as West pulled off the top of the box. Just chocolate. Sweet chocolate. Truffles that had the lovely dark brown shine. 

“Those chocolates are probably dust by now,” said Devi.

They should have been. But they weren’t. West picked up one of the chocolates. Firm. Apparently fresh.

“They don’t look all that old,” he said. 

“Chocolate is full of preservatives,” Nellie shrugged.

But even as she spoke, the chocolate dissolved in his fingers, turning to mush. He gagged and dropped it, tossing the box on the bed. He could smell the awful scent of the rotten chocolate on his fingers, no matter how much he tried to wipe it off.

“Real smooth, West,” said Nellie. “Let’s keeping looking around.”

“That is… shockingly convenient,” said West, squelching across the surprisingly wet carpet to her. The rot in this house was everywhere.

“Maybe it’s a prop for ghost tours like us,” Nellie said. 

“It’s old, I think,” said Devi. “Some of the ink has bled, but it looks like a letter from Bradford to his daughter, Tara. He’s apologizing for… something. ‘You have responsibilities no one should have to bear, and I’m sorry I doomed you to this lonely existence.’ That’s sad, it’s not his fault he got sick.”

“Tell that to the doctors’ warnings on cigar boxes,” Nellie snorted.

“Here, West, you keep reading,” said Devi, shoving the letter into her hands.

West skimmed to the end, where Bradford’s handwriting became erratic. That’s where all the good stuff would be. He mumbled out loud as he read.

“The weight we carry is a burden unasked for, unwanted, shackles to this world and others and I will not let anyone take blame from me for my part in it. If I could die in your stead, I would, and perhaps it would be enough. Just one. Just this once. A sacrifice, if you can make it. And then you can run far away from here, forget the shackles and the burden and be free. Be brave, Tara, and let me give you this. Be brave and take the gift.”

The three crewmembers were silent for a moment, the only sound West’s boots shifting on the wet carpet.

“But we don’t know if she killed him,” said West.

Maybe she didn’t listen. Maybe she let him die of natural causes. Or maybe…

“We don’t even know if this note is real,” said Nellie.

West placed the crumpled note back on the bed. 

“Real or not, it’s not exactly Spooktacular Investigations material,” said West. “Let’s focus on stuff that’s more visual. For the audience.” 

“Like what?” asked Nellie.

He could barely fathom the embarrassment of opening the wardrobe with that line only to reveal rotting mink coats.

“What is that?” Nellie gasped.

The wardrobe was a door, not a wardrobe, leading down into the ground, into darkness.
“It is a creepy secret passageway,” West declared. 

“We are not going down into the scary secret passageway in the demonic occult building,” said Devi. “Besides, it’s too dark for us to really see what’s down there, anyway.”

Devi was right, but the ghosts in the wall-mass had suddenly grown restless, their writhing taking on a frantic air as they pressed further into the pictures. Away from the wardrobe and whatever it led to. Which meant that, whatever was down there, it would most likely be devoid of spectral visitors. 

“I guess we could just ignore the big mystery and move on…” said West.

[[Basement - West&#39;s Tour (with Locket)]]

[[Gallery - West&#39;s Tour (with Locket)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1323" name="Gallery - West&#39;s Tour (with Locket)" tags="" position="850,1175" size="100,100">A high thick fence enclosed either side of the path to the garden and eventually the gallery, creating a strange tunnel-like effect despite the open night sky above them. There were a few ghosts on the path, ignoring them, and West ignored them in turn, breathing in the salty air. Salt? A mineral taste, at least, not with the graininess of sand, but more a flavor of barbeque. The smell only intensified as the path and fence opened wide around the garden. 

“I don’t know what I expected from a garden in the desert,” West chuckled as he filmed a slow circle around them.

The plants were all cacti, most of them taller than West who towered over his other crew members by a foot at least. The smallest ones came up to the diminutive Devi’s waste. Every cacti boasted blooming flowers some just one impressive bloom at their “head,” others clustered together, all emitting that salty scent. The blooms varied from a pale pink to a deep bloody red.

“Hold that position,” said West to Nellie, getting a close up of her fingers gently caressing a petal.

There were large needles just on the other side of that pretty pink and he bit back a warning, worried Nellie would caress more heavily to spite her and split open her hand. A stupid thought. Surely the needles weren’t that sharp.

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” said Devi.

“Oh shit,” said Nellie, hopping off the gravel to the dirt that surrounded it. “Did we mess up some kind of art piece? Shit!”

“No, I mean the layout of the path,” said Devi, gesturing down.

Instead of following her gesture, West followed the path of the lone ghost who shared the garden with them, a woman in a long lacey skirt and a messy braid down her back. She was intent as she followed the gravel swirl that brought them to the center of the planted cacti before leading them out and onward to the beige-pink hexagon-shaped building in front of them. Its boarded-up windows weren’t very inviting, but that wasn’t stopping the ghost’s progress towards the gallery, so it would not stop the crew’s progress either. 

“It’s like a mandala, I think,” said West, filming the ghost making its way along the path. Even if she did not show a mere flicker or orb on playback, it at least helped him keep a steady pace. “Not really occult, but kind of mystic I guess.”

Devi shrugged, maybe in agreement, but she was distracted by her headphones.

“Anything good?” Nellie asked her.

Devi was turning slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room, completely bypassing the ghost that frowned when she noticed her audience and disappeared.

“Actually, there might be,” she said. “Coming from the gallery. It’s like… well, we could just be getting an errant radio signal, but I think I hear music. I think it’s coming through the mic, it’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

Nellie was about to reach for Devi’s headphones, but West swatted her hand and they stood in silence for almost a minute, barely breathing.

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said. “West, maybe you could read the guidebook entry from here? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

West flipped through the guidebook, finding the page for the garden and cacti first, and his stomach dropped. There was a picture of the flowers, the needles, and a hand cut nearly in half. Yes, it was highly stylized, and even the apparent gore that poured from the wound had been artistically rendered in a floral deep green. But it just made him sure that he had been right to worry. Those needles. That smell. Metallic. He flipped the page to the gallery. 

“Looks like there are a couple big ticket items still being stored here,” West said, sharing the illustrations of the art with Devi as Nellie impatiently shifted forward to where the actual art pieces were waiting for them. “The captions say these are the originals, commissioned by Bradford, and they’ve never left the property. Have to assume a lot of people would want to get their hands on them. For the clout, I mean. Some of them are… modern.”

“Not a modern art fan?” asked Devi.

“I prefer the Impressionists,” said West.

His crew reacted with teasing //oooohs// as they followed West to the Gallery.  

“Keep the door open,” Nellie instructed West who nodded, happy to let in the small amount of starlight into the spacious room. The shadows made by the art pieces looked more malevolent than the cacti needles, but the room was thankfully ghost-free. 

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

Well. Some of the pieces were. 

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped completely when we came inside,” she said.

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. The ghost-free room did not respond.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West, the image of that needle-slice art making him anxious once more to get this night over with.

“Good idea,” said Nellie. “Let’s poke around.”

“Here, West, you keep reading,” said Devi, shoving the letter into her hands.

West skimmed to the end, where Bradford’s handwriting became erratic. That’s where all the good stuff would be. He mumbled out loud as he read.

“The weight we carry is a burden unasked for, unwanted, shackles to this world and others and I will not let anyone take blame from me for my part in it. If I could die in your stead, I would, and perhaps it would be enough. Just one. Just this once. A sacrifice, if you can make it. And then you can run far away from here, forget the shackles and the burden and be free. Be brave, Tara, and let me give you this. Be brave and take the gift.”

The three crewmembers were silent for a moment, the only sound West’s boots shifting on the wet carpet.

“But we don’t know if she killed him,” said West.

Maybe she didn’t listen. Maybe she let him die of natural causes. Or maybe…

“We don’t even know if this note is real,” said Nellie.

West placed the crumpled note back on the bed. 

“Real or not, it’s not exactly Spooktacular Investigations material,” said West. “Let’s focus on stuff that’s more visual. For the audience.” 

“Like what?” asked Nellie.

He could barely fathom the embarrassment of opening the wardrobe with that line only to reveal rotting mink coats.

“What is that?” Nellie gasped.

The wardrobe was a door, not a wardrobe, leading down into the ground, into darkness.
“It is a creepy secret passageway,” West declared. 

“We are not going down into the scary secret passageway in the demonic occult building,” said Devi. “Besides, it’s too dark for us to really see what’s down there, anyway.”

Devi was right, but the ghosts in the wall-mass had suddenly grown restless, their writhing taking on a frantic air as they pressed further into the pictures. Away from the wardrobe and whatever it led to. Which meant that, whatever was down there, it would most likely be devoid of spectral visitors. 

“I guess we could just ignore the big mystery and move on…” said West.

There were a few ghosts on the path, ignoring them, and West ignored them in turn, breathing in the salty air. Salt? A mineral taste, at least, not with the graininess of sand, but more a flavor of barbeque. The smell only intensified as the path and fence opened wide around the garden. 

“I don’t know what I expected from a garden in the desert,” West chuckled as he filmed a slow circle around them.

The plants were all cacti, most of them taller than West who towered over his other crew members by a foot at least. The smallest ones came up to the diminutive Devi’s waste. Every cacti boasted blooming flowers some just one impressive bloom at their “head,” others clustered together, all emitting that salty scent. The blooms varied from a pale pink to a deep bloody red.

“Hold that position,” said West to Nellie, getting a close up of her fingers gently caressing a petal.

There were large needles just on the other side of that pretty pink and he bit back a warning, worried Nellie would caress more heavily to spite her and split open her hand. A stupid thought. Surely the needles weren’t that sharp.

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” said Devi.

“Oh shit,” said Nellie, hopping off the gravel to the dirt that surrounded it. “Did we mess up some kind of art piece? Shit!”

“No, I mean the layout of the path,” said Devi, gesturing down.

Instead of following her gesture, West followed the path of the lone ghost who shared the garden with them, a woman in a long lacey skirt and a messy braid down her back. She was intent as she followed the gravel swirl that brought them to the center of the planted cacti before leading them out and onward to the beige-pink hexagon-shaped building in front of them. Its boarded-up windows weren’t very inviting, but that wasn’t stopping the ghost’s progress towards the gallery, so it would not stop the crew’s progress either. 

“It’s like a mandala, I think,” said West, filming the ghost making its way along the path. Even if she did not show a mere flicker or orb on playback, it at least helped him keep a steady pace. “Not really occult, but kind of mystic I guess.”

Devi shrugged, maybe in agreement, but she was distracted by her headphones.

“Anything good?” Nellie asked her.

Devi was turning slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room, completely bypassing the ghost that frowned when she noticed her audience and disappeared.

“Actually, there might be,” she said. “Coming from the gallery. It’s like… well, we could just be getting an errant radio signal, but I think I hear music. I think it’s coming through the mic, it’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

Nellie was about to reach for Devi’s headphones, but West swatted her hand and they stood in silence for almost a minute, barely breathing.

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said. “West, maybe you could read the guidebook entry from here? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

West flipped through the guidebook, finding the page for the garden and cacti first, and his stomach dropped. There was a picture of the flowers, the needles, and a hand cut nearly in half. Yes, it was highly stylized, and even the apparent gore that poured from the wound had been artistically rendered in a floral deep green. But it just made him sure that he had been right to worry. Those needles. That smell. Metallic. He flipped the page to the gallery. 

“Looks like there are a couple big ticket items still being stored here,” West said, sharing the illustrations of the art with Devi as Nellie impatiently shifted forward to where the actual art pieces were waiting for them. “The captions say these are the originals, commissioned by Bradford, and they’ve never left the property. Have to assume a lot of people would want to get their hands on them. For the clout, I mean. Some of them are… modern.”

“Not a modern art fan?” asked Devi.

“I prefer the Impressionists,” said West.

His crew reacted with teasing //oooohs// as they followed West to the Gallery.  

“Keep the door open,” Nellie instructed West who nodded, happy to let in the small amount of starlight into the spacious room. The shadows made by the art pieces looked more malevolent than the cacti needles, but the room was thankfully ghost-free. 

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

Well. Some of the pieces were. 

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped completely when we came inside,” she said.

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. The ghost-free room did not respond.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West, the image of that needle-slice art making him anxious once more to get this night over with.

“Good idea,” said Nellie. “Let’s poke around.”

“That is… shockingly convenient,” said West, squelching across the surprisingly wet carpet to her. The rot in this house was everywhere.

“Maybe it’s a prop for ghost tours like us,” Nellie said. 

“It’s old, I think,” said Devi. “Some of the ink has bled, but it looks like a letter from Bradford to his daughter, Tara. He’s apologizing for… something. ‘You have responsibilities no one should have to bear, and I’m sorry I doomed you to this lonely existence.’ That’s sad, it’s not his fault he got sick.”

“No, I mean the layout of the path,” said Devi, gesturing down.

Instead of following her gesture, West followed the path of the lone ghost who shared the garden with them, a woman in a long lacey skirt and a messy braid down her back. She was intent as she followed the gravel swirl that brought them to the center of the planted cacti before leading them out and onward to the beige-pink hexagon-shaped building in front of them. Its boarded-up windows weren’t very inviting, but that wasn’t stopping the ghost’s progress towards the gallery, so it would not stop the crew’s progress either. 

“It’s like a mandala, I think,” said West, filming the ghost making its way along the path. Even if she did not show a mere flicker or orb on playback, it at least helped him keep a steady pace. “Not really occult, but kind of mystic I guess.”

Devi shrugged, maybe in agreement, but she was distracted by her headphones.

“Anything good?” Nellie asked her.

Devi was turning slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room, completely bypassing the ghost that frowned when she noticed her audience and disappeared.

“Actually, there might be,” she said. “Coming from the gallery. It’s like… well, we could just be getting an errant radio signal, but I think I hear music. I think it’s coming through the mic, it’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

Nellie was about to reach for Devi’s headphones, but West swatted her hand and they stood in silence for almost a minute, barely breathing.

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said. “West, maybe you could read the guidebook entry from here? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

West flipped through the guidebook, finding the page for the garden and cacti first, and his stomach dropped. There was a picture of the flowers, the needles, and a hand cut nearly in half. Yes, it was highly stylized, and even the apparent gore that poured from the wound had been artistically rendered in a floral deep green. But it just made him sure that he had been right to worry. Those needles. That smell. Metallic. He flipped the page to the gallery. 

“Looks like there are a couple big ticket items still being stored here,” West said, sharing the illustrations of the art with Devi as Nellie impatiently shifted forward to where the actual art pieces were waiting for them. “The captions say these are the originals, commissioned by Bradford, and they’ve never left the property. Have to assume a lot of people would want to get their hands on them. For the clout, I mean. Some of them are… modern.”

“Not a modern art fan?” asked Devi.

“I prefer the Impressionists,” said West.

His crew reacted with teasing //oooohs// as they followed West to the Gallery.  

“Keep the door open,” Nellie instructed West who nodded, happy to let in the small amount of starlight into the spacious room. The shadows made by the art pieces looked more malevolent than the cacti needles, but the room was thankfully ghost-free. 

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

Well. Some of the pieces were. 

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped completely when we came inside,” she said.

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. The ghost-free room did not respond.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West, the image of that needle-slice art making him anxious once more to get this night over with.

“Good idea,” said Nellie. “Let’s poke around.”

But if I die here, I am coming back to haunt you,” said Nellie.

“I completely understand, and you have my full permission,” said West. “Devi, if it’s too scary for you-”

“I’m coming,” Devi grumbled. “Someone has to record your screams for posterity.”

West led the way down the stairs. The red light from the camera, and the assorted lights from Devi’s recorder offered barely enough light for them to not trip over their feet on the way down. But West felt a calm settle over him as he descended, a warmth he would not have expected to feel going underground. He turned out Nellie and Devi’s semi-flirtatious bickering, enjoying the sound of his own quiet breaths, undisturbed by flashes in the corner of his eye or the weight of another presence pressing down on him. 

“Is it getting lighter?” asked West.

He was right. The steps became more visible, the descent safer, until they reached solid ground. The light was gentle, a faint starlight kind of illumination, emenating from an object in the middle of the room.

“Is that… it looks like an altar,” said Devi, her voice quavering slightly.

Nellie walked towards it, and West followed at her shoulder, the two leaving Devi behind them in the shadows. West knew, logically, that this was the kind of dangerous thing he should pull Nellie away from, but he could not help how much he liked it down here. The quiet. The feeling that as long as he stayed here, those spirits that plagued him would leave him alone. If the gentle, warm light kept the ghosts away, he was in no rush to leave.

Nellie set a hand on the flat, round surface of the altar, and it was perfectly smooth except for a deep engraving that ran in two elegant lines.

“A ‘V,’” murmured Devi.

“Horns,” said West.

And to his surprise, he shivered.

“We should leave the house,” said Nellie.

“We don’t have enough footage yet for the show,” West protested. 

He wiped his hand across his brow, suddenly breaking into a cold sweat. Was he scared? Was he terrified? Did Nellie or Devi notice?

“The owner doesn’t usually let investigators see the gallery, everything’s super fragile in there,” Devi said. “We can’t lose this opportunity. Unless… unless you’re really not feeling well or something like that?”

Nellie shrugged. 

“Okay, let’s go,” said West.

If he sounded any pushier than usual, Nellie didn’t give him crap about it. He wondered if she felt as sick as he did. Even feeling ill, he felt a pang of regret as they walked back up the stairs. It was peaceful in the basement. Wrong. Disturbing. But peaceful nonetheless.

There were a few ghosts on the path, ignoring them, and West ignored them in turn, breathing in the salty air. Salt? A mineral taste, at least, not with the graininess of sand, but more a flavor of barbeque. The smell only intensified as the path and fence opened wide around the garden. 

“I don’t know what I expected from a garden in the desert,” West chuckled as he filmed a slow circle around them.

The plants were all cacti, most of them taller than West who towered over his other crew members by a foot at least. The smallest ones came up to the diminutive Devi’s waste. Every cacti boasted blooming flowers some just one impressive bloom at their “head,” others clustered together, all emitting that salty scent. The blooms varied from a pale pink to a deep bloody red.

“Hold that position,” said West to Nellie, getting a close up of her fingers gently caressing a petal.

There were large needles just on the other side of that pretty pink and he bit back a warning, worried Nellie would caress more heavily to spite her and split open her hand. A stupid thought. Surely the needles weren’t that sharp.

[[Portrait of the Bennington Family - West&#39;s Tour with Sludge (Basement with Locket)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1347" name="Gallery - West&#39;s Tour with Sludge (Basement with Diary)" tags="" position="850,1175" size="100,100">A high thick fence enclosed either side of the path to the garden and eventually the gallery, creating a strange tunnel-like effect despite the open night sky above them. There were a few ghosts on the path, ignoring them, and West ignored them in turn, breathing in the salty air. Salt? A mineral taste, at least, not with the graininess of sand, but more a flavor of barbeque. The smell only intensified as the path and fence opened wide around the garden. 

“I don’t know what I expected from a garden in the desert,” West chuckled as he filmed a slow circle around them.

The plants were all cacti, most of them taller than West who towered over his other crew members by a foot at least. The smallest ones came up to the diminutive Devi’s waste. Every cacti boasted blooming flowers some just one impressive bloom at their “head,” others clustered together, all emitting that salty scent. The blooms varied from a pale pink to a deep bloody red.

“Hold that position,” said West to Nellie, getting a close up of her fingers gently caressing a petal.

There were large needles just on the other side of that pretty pink and he bit back a warning, worried Nellie would caress more heavily to spite her and split open her hand. A stupid thought. Surely the needles weren’t that sharp.

“The gravel patterns remind me of those old Buddhist zen gardens,” said Devi.

“Oh shit,” said Nellie, hopping off the gravel to the dirt that surrounded it. “Did we mess up some kind of art piece? Shit!”

“No, I mean the layout of the path,” said Devi, gesturing down.

Instead of following her gesture, West followed the path of the lone ghost who shared the garden with them, a woman in a long lacey skirt and a messy braid down her back. She was intent as she followed the gravel swirl that brought them to the center of the planted cacti before leading them out and onward to the beige-pink hexagon-shaped building in front of them. Its boarded-up windows weren’t very inviting, but that wasn’t stopping the ghost’s progress towards the gallery, so it would not stop the crew’s progress either. 

“It’s like a mandala, I think,” said West, filming the ghost making its way along the path. Even if she did not show a mere flicker or orb on playback, it at least helped him keep a steady pace. “Not really occult, but kind of mystic I guess.”

Devi shrugged, maybe in agreement, but she was distracted by her headphones.

“Anything good?” Nellie asked her.

Devi was turning slowly, towards the house, then the cacti, then the wall, then the final room, completely bypassing the ghost that frowned when she noticed her audience and disappeared.

“Actually, there might be,” she said. “Coming from the gallery. It’s like… well, we could just be getting an errant radio signal, but I think I hear music. I think it’s coming through the mic, it’s clearer when I point it towards the gallery.”

Nellie was about to reach for Devi’s headphones, but West swatted her hand and they stood in silence for almost a minute, barely breathing.

“Did you get it?” West asked.

Devi grinned and nodded and West fist pumped the air. 

“I bet we’ll get more inside,” Devi said. “West, maybe you could read the guidebook entry from here? It could make a nice transition voice over.”

“Wait, don’t you have to go through Bradford’s room to get to the gallery?” West asked. “Why would there by an entry for a room you couldn’t visit?”

West flipped through the guidebook, finding the page for the garden and cacti first, and his stomach dropped. There was a picture of the flowers, the needles, and a hand cut nearly in half. Yes, it was highly stylized, and even the apparent gore that poured from the wound had been artistically rendered in a floral deep green. But it just made him sure that he had been right to worry. Those needles. That smell. Metallic. He flipped the page to the gallery. 

“Looks like there are a couple big ticket items still being stored here,” West said, sharing the illustrations of the art with Devi as Nellie impatiently shifted forward to where the actual art pieces were waiting for them. “The captions say these are the originals, commissioned by Bradford, and they’ve never left the property. Have to assume a lot of people would want to get their hands on them. For the clout, I mean. Some of them are… modern.”

“Not a modern art fan?” asked Devi.

“I prefer the Impressionists,” said West.

His crew reacted with teasing //oooohs// as they followed West to the Gallery.  

“Keep the door open,” Nellie instructed West who nodded, happy to let in the small amount of starlight into the spacious room. The shadows made by the art pieces looked more malevolent than the cacti needles, but the room was thankfully ghost-free. 

“They’re gorgeous,” whispered Devi.

Well. Some of the pieces were. 

“Do you hear the music?” Nellie asked, but Devi shook her head.

“It stopped completely when we came inside,” she said.

“Is somebody trying to contact us?” Nellie asked. “A music lover, perhaps? Mark? Dawn? Tara? One of their friends who didn’t want the party to end?”

They were quiet for a minute. The ghost-free room did not respond.

“Maybe they’ll get mad if we poke around,” said West, the image of that needle-slice art making him anxious once more to get this night over with.

“Good idea,” said Nellie. “Let’s poke around.”

They stared into the dip of the giant bowl. Devi glared at West, clearly expecting him to say something dismissive, but West was actually… compelled? Is this how modern art was supposed to make you feel? The subtle curve of the bowl, the design spreading through it was hypnotic. It made him feel melancholy. It made him feel sick.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. 

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. 

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip, directing their attention to a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

He was glad Nellie had touched it and not him. He wanted to touch it. He did not know why. He did not know why he felt the need to reach out for things that were going to hurt him, why the things that wanted to hurt him always seemed eager to reach back. He blinked away tears before Nellie or Devi could see them. 

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

He supposed it looked like three women dancing. If you squinted. Or looked past them and just tried to glance at them out of the corner of your eye. Which seemed like a weird way to view a work of art, but probably the right way, because it did do something strange. The way the blur made the trio split in his vision, each trio creating its own trio, gave the illusion of movement. Interesting, perhaps, but it did not change how unnerving their blank, faceless… faces… were.

Modern art usually had some metaphorical meaning that was more important than the art itself. Even just thinking that to himself made West feel unbelievably pretentious. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi proposed.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

West could tell Devi was about to say something else, maybe argue with Nellie or give a long history about why three women dancing together was artistic, or sexist, or historically significant, but those blank faces were starting to creep him out.

“As the leader, I say we leave them to their dance,” West said, turning his camera to capture the rest of the gallery. 

[[Gallery 1 - West&#39;s Tour (with Locket from the Triad)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1350" name="A Constellation - West&#39;s Tour (with Locket)" tags="" position="850,1175" size="100,100">Six faded white blocks of different sizes were scattered around the room.

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked, feeling stupid.

“If it is, I don’t get it,” said Nellie, making West feel slightly better.

“I think it represents…” Devi said, trailing off as West and Nellie tried to hide their smirks. “Never mind!”

“No, Devi, please, what do the white blocks represent?” West asked, pointing the camera at her.

She stuck her tongue out for the audience.

“I think they represent the limitation of verbal communication,” Nellie said with faux seriousness.

West swept the camera over to her.

“Or perhaps the limitlessness of visual communication,” he suggested and she nodded sagely.

“Fine, I’ll keep my analysis to myself!” Devi said while West and Nellie giggled. 

[[Gallery 1 - West&#39;s Tour (with Locket from A Constellation)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1351" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - West&#39;s Tour (with Locket)" tags="" position="850,1300" size="100,100">West did a slow zoom out of the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but there was something wrong with the colors. They blended into shadows that did not exist, like some darkness was creeping over the paint, pulling the figures back into a void. It felt like… there should be spirits there. Maybe they had already been swallowed by that darkness. West wondered if the others noticed him looking for the ghosts that were not there and tried to think of something light-hearted to say, a quip for the camera. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West said, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued, and if it came out a little forcefully, neither Devi nor Nellie reacted to it.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were bright blue under her fringe, with alight with a strange sorrowful accusation that made West avert his eyes. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that made it look like she was on her way to a Renaissance fair. It was cut low over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair fell in loose curls down her shoulders, and she lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, and West new that it must have been a hard position to hold, but Dawn seemed adept at performing her false relaxation. He left her to it. His eye was drawn to the man beside her.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.
Mark stood side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise, another precarious pose, another performance of ease, but Mark did not play his part quite so well. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. It was so carefully curated it set West’s teeth on edge, like something uncanny, almost veering into the inhuman. Which was ridiculous. Objectively, the man in the picture was just a man, if a very manicured one, his outfit not outrageous for the time. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro was pristine. Maybe it was his smile, that sneer, that made West want to run, that seemed to whisper in his ear// run run run//. Did he want to run from Mark? Was he responding to a threat? Or was a receiving a warning? 

West shook his head. He was not receiving a warning from a painting. There were no ghosts in this painting. He would feel them. He felt nothing in the darkness creeping over the paint. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn. Her deep brown eyes were wide and afraid, focused on something out of frame, and West felt that urge to run again, or to tell Tara to run, and he swallowed it down. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded almost completely into that suffocating void, like he could have been made of the darkness itself. He was shaped a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting something like a hand on Tara’s shoulder, but everything about him made West’s skin crawl. He did not look like any ghost West had seen. He did not look like the other Benningtons posed around him. So, who was he? If there were no ghosts in the gallery, what was possessing this portrait? 

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but West did not think he was. He thought he was something much worse than a dead man. They needed to leave.

//Run. //

“Right,” said West, keeping his voice calm. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go?”

“Hey, guys,” said Devi, stopping West after he took his first few steps towards the door. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

Classic haunting. West was surprised at how relieved he felt. He knew how to handle ghostly music. The normalcy took away some of his urgency, dampened a bit of his fear.

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

But as he turned to walk to her, he stumbled over his feet, and without thinking, he reached out to steady himself. His hand pressed against the painting. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands of their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and West heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building. West could still hear that sound through the chaos, some familiar noises mixed in with the static, melodies and lyrics, songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for West to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

“No, Devi, please, what do the white blocks represent?” West asked, pointing the camera at her.

She stuck her tongue out for the audience.

“I think they represent the limitation of verbal communication,” Nellie said with faux seriousness.

West swept the camera over to her.

“Or perhaps the limitlessness of visual communication,” he suggested and she nodded sagely.

“Fine, I’ll keep my analysis to myself!” Devi said while West and Nellie giggled.

He supposed it looked like three women dancing. If you squinted. Or looked past them and just tried to glance at them out of the corner of your eye. Which seemed like a weird way to view a work of art, but probably the right way, because it did do something strange. The way the blur made the trio split in his vision, each trio creating its own trio, gave the illusion of movement. Interesting, perhaps, but it did not change how unnerving their blank, faceless… faces… were.

Modern art usually had some metaphorical meaning that was more important than the art itself. Even just thinking that to himself made West feel unbelievably pretentious. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi proposed.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

West could tell Devi was about to say something else, maybe argue with Nellie or give a long history about why three women dancing together was artistic, or sexist, or historically significant, but those blank faces were starting to creep him out.

“As the leader, I say we leave them to their dance,” West said, turning his camera to capture the rest of the gallery.

They stared into the dip of the giant bowl. Devi glared at West, clearly expecting him to say something dismissive, but West was actually… compelled? Is this how modern art was supposed to make you feel? The subtle curve of the bowl, the design spreading through it was hypnotic. It made him feel melancholy. It made him feel sick.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. 

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. 

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip, directing their attention to a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

He was glad Nellie had touched it and not him. He wanted to touch it. He did not know why. He did not know why he felt the need to reach out for things that were going to hurt him, why the things that wanted to hurt him always seemed eager to reach back. He blinked away tears before Nellie or Devi could see them. 

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1370" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - West&#39;s Tour (Basement with Locket)" tags="" position="975,1300" size="100,100">West did a slow zoom out of the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but there was something wrong with the colors. They blended into shadows that did not exist, like some darkness was creeping over the paint, pulling the figures back into a void. It felt like… there should be spirits there. Maybe they had already been swallowed by that darkness. West wondered if the others noticed him looking for the ghosts that were not there and tried to think of something light-hearted to say, a quip for the camera. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West said, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued, and if it came out a little forcefully, neither Devi nor Nellie reacted to it.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were bright blue under her fringe, with alight with a strange sorrowful accusation that made West avert his eyes. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that made it look like she was on her way to a Renaissance fair. It was cut low over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair fell in loose curls down her shoulders, and she lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, and West new that it must have been a hard position to hold, but Dawn seemed adept at performing her false relaxation. He left her to it. His eye was drawn to the man beside her.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.
Mark stood side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise, another precarious pose, another performance of ease, but Mark did not play his part quite so well. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. It was so carefully curated it set West’s teeth on edge, like something uncanny, almost veering into the inhuman. Which was ridiculous. Objectively, the man in the picture was just a man, if a very manicured one, his outfit not outrageous for the time. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro was pristine. Maybe it was his smile, that sneer, that made West want to run, that seemed to whisper in his ear// run run run//. Did he want to run from Mark? Was he responding to a threat? Or was a receiving a warning? 

West shook his head. He was not receiving a warning from a painting. There were no ghosts in this painting. He would feel them. He felt nothing in the darkness creeping over the paint. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn. Her deep brown eyes were wide and afraid, focused on something out of frame, and West felt that urge to run again, or to tell Tara to run, and he swallowed it down. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded almost completely into that suffocating void, like he could have been made of the darkness itself. He was shaped a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting something like a hand on Tara’s shoulder, but everything about him made West’s skin crawl. He did not look like any ghost West had seen. He did not look like the other Benningtons posed around him. So, who was he? If there were no ghosts in the gallery, what was possessing this portrait? 

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but West did not think he was. He thought he was something much worse than a dead man. They needed to leave.

//Run. //

“Right,” said West, keeping his voice calm. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go?”

“Hey, guys,” said Devi, stopping West after he took his first few steps towards the door. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

Classic haunting. West was surprised at how relieved he felt. He knew how to handle ghostly music. The normalcy took away some of his urgency, dampened a bit of his fear.

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

But as he turned to walk to her, he stumbled over his feet, and without thinking, he reached out to steady himself. His hand pressed against the painting. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands of their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and West heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building. West could still hear that sound through the chaos, some familiar noises mixed in with the static, melodies and lyrics, songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for West to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

He supposed it looked like three women dancing. If you squinted. Or looked past them and just tried to glance at them out of the corner of your eye. Which seemed like a weird way to view a work of art, but probably the right way, because it did do something strange.

Modern art usually had some metaphorical meaning that was more important than the art itself. Even just thinking that to himself made West feel unbelievably pretentious. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi proposed.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

West could tell Devi was about to say something else, maybe argue with Nellie or give a long history about why three women dancing together was artistic, or sexist, or historically significant, but those blank faces were starting to creep him out.

“As the leader, I say we leave them to their dance,” West said, turning his camera to capture the rest of the gallery.

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked, feeling stupid.

“If it is, I don’t get it,” said Nellie, making West feel slightly better.

“I think it represents…” Devi said, trailing off as West and Nellie tried to hide their smirks. “Never mind!”

“No, Devi, please, what do the white blocks represent?” West asked, pointing the camera at her.

She stuck her tongue out for the audience.

“I think they represent the limitation of verbal communication,” Nellie said with faux seriousness.

West swept the camera over to her.

“Or perhaps the limitlessness of visual communication,” he suggested and she nodded sagely.

“Fine, I’ll keep my analysis to myself!” Devi said while West and Nellie giggled. 

[[Gallery 1 - West&#39;s Tour with Sludge (with Locket from A Constellation)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1389" name="Portrait of the Bennington Family - West&#39;s Tour with Sludge (with Locket)" tags="" position="1100,1300" size="100,100">West did a slow zoom out of the portrait of the Bennington family that took up almost the entirety of one wall. The figures in it were life-size, but there was something wrong with the colors. They blended into shadows that did not exist, like some darkness was creeping over the paint, pulling the figures back into a void. It felt like… there should be spirits there. Maybe they had already been swallowed by that darkness. West wondered if the others noticed him looking for the ghosts that were not there and tried to think of something light-hearted to say, a quip for the camera. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West said, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued, and if it came out a little forcefully, neither Devi nor Nellie reacted to it.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were bright blue under her fringe, with alight with a strange sorrowful accusation that made West avert his eyes. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that made it look like she was on her way to a Renaissance fair. It was cut low over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair fell in loose curls down her shoulders, and she lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, and West new that it must have been a hard position to hold, but Dawn seemed adept at performing her false relaxation. He left her to it. His eye was drawn to the man beside her.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.
Mark stood side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise, another precarious pose, another performance of ease, but Mark did not play his part quite so well. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. It was so carefully curated it set West’s teeth on edge, like something uncanny, almost veering into the inhuman. Which was ridiculous. Objectively, the man in the picture was just a man, if a very manicured one, his outfit not outrageous for the time. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro was pristine. Maybe it was his smile, that sneer, that made West want to run, that seemed to whisper in his ear// run run run//. Did he want to run from Mark? Was he responding to a threat? Or was a receiving a warning? 

West shook his head. He was not receiving a warning from a painting. There were no ghosts in this painting. He would feel them. He felt nothing in the darkness creeping over the paint. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn. Her deep brown eyes were wide and afraid, focused on something out of frame, and West felt that urge to run again, or to tell Tara to run, and he swallowed it down. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded almost completely into that suffocating void, like he could have been made of the darkness itself. He was shaped a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting something like a hand on Tara’s shoulder, but everything about him made West’s skin crawl. He did not look like any ghost West had seen. He did not look like the other Benningtons posed around him. So, who was he? If there were no ghosts in the gallery, what was possessing this portrait? 

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but West did not think he was. He thought he was something much worse than a dead man. They needed to leave.

//Run. //

“Right,” said West, keeping his voice calm. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go?”

“Hey, guys,” said Devi, stopping West after he took his first few steps towards the door. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

Classic haunting. West was surprised at how relieved he felt. He knew how to handle ghostly music. The normalcy took away some of his urgency, dampened a bit of his fear.

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

But as he turned to walk to her, he stumbled over his feet, and without thinking, he reached out to steady himself. His hand pressed against the painting. 

He felt a sharp pain, like his skin was splitting open, a searing rupture so intense that when he opened his mouth to scream no sound came out. There was a darkness growing from under his palm and a terrible sour smell. Mold? It spread out from his burning hand, over the painting, obscuring the faces of the Bennington children under the new wet growth.

“What the hell?” whispered Nellie.

West wrenched his hand free. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands of their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and West heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building. West could still hear that sound through the chaos, some familiar noises mixed in with the static, melodies and lyrics, songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for West to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

Maybe they had already been swallowed by that darkness. West wondered if the others noticed him looking for the ghosts that were not there and tried to think of something light-hearted to say, a quip for the camera. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West said, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued, and if it came out a little forcefully, neither Devi nor Nellie reacted to it.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were bright blue under her fringe, with alight with a strange sorrowful accusation that made West avert his eyes. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that made it look like she was on her way to a Renaissance fair. It was cut low over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair fell in loose curls down her shoulders, and she lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, and West new that it must have been a hard position to hold, but Dawn seemed adept at performing her false relaxation. He left her to it. His eye was drawn to the man beside her.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.
Mark stood side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise, another precarious pose, another performance of ease, but Mark did not play his part quite so well. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. It was so carefully curated it set West’s teeth on edge, like something uncanny, almost veering into the inhuman. Which was ridiculous. Objectively, the man in the picture was just a man, if a very manicured one, his outfit not outrageous for the time. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro was pristine. Maybe it was his smile, that sneer, that made West want to run, that seemed to whisper in his ear// run run run//. Did he want to run from Mark? Was he responding to a threat? Or was a receiving a warning? 

West shook his head. He was not receiving a warning from a painting. There were no ghosts in this painting. He would feel them. He felt nothing in the darkness creeping over the paint. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn. Her deep brown eyes were wide and afraid, focused on something out of frame, and West felt that urge to run again, or to tell Tara to run, and he swallowed it down. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded almost completely into that suffocating void, like he could have been made of the darkness itself. He was shaped a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting something like a hand on Tara’s shoulder, but everything about him made West’s skin crawl. He did not look like any ghost West had seen. He did not look like the other Benningtons posed around him. So, who was he? If there were no ghosts in the gallery, what was possessing this portrait? 

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but West did not think he was. He thought he was something much worse than a dead man. They needed to leave.

//Run. //

“Right,” said West, keeping his voice calm. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go?”

“Hey, guys,” said Devi, stopping West after he took his first few steps towards the door. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

Classic haunting. West was surprised at how relieved he felt. He knew how to handle ghostly music. The normalcy took away some of his urgency, dampened a bit of his fear.

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

But as he turned to walk to her, he stumbled over his feet, and without thinking, he reached out to steady himself. His hand pressed against the painting. 

He felt a sharp pain, like his skin was splitting open, a searing rupture so intense that when he opened his mouth to scream no sound came out. There was a darkness growing from under his palm and a terrible sour smell. Mold? It spread out from his burning hand, over the painting, obscuring the faces of the Bennington children under the new wet growth.

“What the hell?” whispered Nellie.

West wrenched his hand free. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands of their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and West heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building. West could still hear that sound through the chaos, some familiar noises mixed in with the static, melodies and lyrics, songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for West to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

West could tell Devi was about to say something else, maybe argue with Nellie or give a long history about why three women dancing together was artistic, or sexist, or historically significant, but those blank faces were starting to creep him out.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. 

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. 

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip, directing their attention to a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

He was glad Nellie had touched it and not him. He wanted to touch it. He did not know why. He did not know why he felt the need to reach out for things that were going to hurt him, why the things that wanted to hurt him always seemed eager to reach back. He blinked away tears before Nellie or Devi could see them.

The figures in it were life-size, but there was something wrong with the colors. They blended into shadows that did not exist, like some darkness was creeping over the paint, pulling the figures back into a void. It felt like… there should be spirits there. Maybe they had already been swallowed by that darkness. West wondered if the others noticed him looking for the ghosts that were not there and tried to think of something light-hearted to say, a quip for the camera. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West said, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued, and if it came out a little forcefully, neither Devi nor Nellie reacted to it.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were bright blue under her fringe, with alight with a strange sorrowful accusation that made West avert his eyes. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that made it look like she was on her way to a Renaissance fair. It was cut low over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair fell in loose curls down her shoulders, and she lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, and West new that it must have been a hard position to hold, but Dawn seemed adept at performing her false relaxation. He left her to it. His eye was drawn to the man beside her.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.
Mark stood side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise, another precarious pose, another performance of ease, but Mark did not play his part quite so well. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. It was so carefully curated it set West’s teeth on edge, like something uncanny, almost veering into the inhuman. Which was ridiculous. Objectively, the man in the picture was just a man, if a very manicured one, his outfit not outrageous for the time. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro was pristine. Maybe it was his smile, that sneer, that made West want to run, that seemed to whisper in his ear// run run run//. Did he want to run from Mark? Was he responding to a threat? Or was a receiving a warning? 

West shook his head. He was not receiving a warning from a painting. There were no ghosts in this painting. He would feel them. He felt nothing in the darkness creeping over the paint. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn. Her deep brown eyes were wide and afraid, focused on something out of frame, and West felt that urge to run again, or to tell Tara to run, and he swallowed it down. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded almost completely into that suffocating void, like he could have been made of the darkness itself. He was shaped a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting something like a hand on Tara’s shoulder, but everything about him made West’s skin crawl. He did not look like any ghost West had seen. He did not look like the other Benningtons posed around him. So, who was he? If there were no ghosts in the gallery, what was possessing this portrait? 

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but West did not think he was. He thought he was something much worse than a dead man. They needed to leave.

//Run. //

“Right,” said West, keeping his voice calm. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go?”

“Hey, guys,” said Devi, stopping West after he took his first few steps towards the door. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

Classic haunting. West was surprised at how relieved he felt. He knew how to handle ghostly music. The normalcy took away some of his urgency, dampened a bit of his fear.

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

But as he turned to walk to her, he stumbled over his feet, and without thinking, he reached out to steady himself. His hand pressed against the painting. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands of their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and West heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building. West could still hear that sound through the chaos, some familiar noises mixed in with the static, melodies and lyrics, songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for West to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

The figures in it were life-size, but there was something wrong with the colors. They blended into shadows that did not exist, like some darkness was creeping over the paint, pulling the figures back into a void. It felt like… there should be spirits there. Maybe they had already been swallowed by that darkness. West wondered if the others noticed him looking for the ghosts that were not there and tried to think of something light-hearted to say, a quip for the camera. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West said, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued, and if it came out a little forcefully, neither Devi nor Nellie reacted to it.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were bright blue under her fringe, with alight with a strange sorrowful accusation that made West avert his eyes. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that made it look like she was on her way to a Renaissance fair. It was cut low over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair fell in loose curls down her shoulders, and she lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, and West new that it must have been a hard position to hold, but Dawn seemed adept at performing her false relaxation. He left her to it. His eye was drawn to the man beside her.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.
Mark stood side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise, another precarious pose, another performance of ease, but Mark did not play his part quite so well. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. It was so carefully curated it set West’s teeth on edge, like something uncanny, almost veering into the inhuman. Which was ridiculous. Objectively, the man in the picture was just a man, if a very manicured one, his outfit not outrageous for the time. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro was pristine. Maybe it was his smile, that sneer, that made West want to run, that seemed to whisper in his ear// run run run//. Did he want to run from Mark? Was he responding to a threat? Or was a receiving a warning? 

West shook his head. He was not receiving a warning from a painting. There were no ghosts in this painting. He would feel them. He felt nothing in the darkness creeping over the paint. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn. Her deep brown eyes were wide and afraid, focused on something out of frame, and West felt that urge to run again, or to tell Tara to run, and he swallowed it down. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded almost completely into that suffocating void, like he could have been made of the darkness itself. He was shaped a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting something like a hand on Tara’s shoulder, but everything about him made West’s skin crawl. He did not look like any ghost West had seen. He did not look like the other Benningtons posed around him. So, who was he? If there were no ghosts in the gallery, what was possessing this portrait? 

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but West did not think he was. He thought he was something much worse than a dead man. They needed to leave.

//Run. //

“Right,” said West, keeping his voice calm. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go?”

“Hey, guys,” said Devi, stopping West after he took his first few steps towards the door. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

Classic haunting. West was surprised at how relieved he felt. He knew how to handle ghostly music. The normalcy took away some of his urgency, dampened a bit of his fear.

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

But as he turned to walk to her, he stumbled over his feet, and without thinking, he reached out to steady himself. His hand pressed against the painting. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands of their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and West heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building. West could still hear that sound through the chaos, some familiar noises mixed in with the static, melodies and lyrics, songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for West to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

Is this how modern art was supposed to make you feel? The subtle curve of the bowl, the design spreading through it was hypnotic. It made him feel melancholy. It made him feel sick.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. 

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. 

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip, directing their attention to a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

He was glad Nellie had touched it and not him. He wanted to touch it. He did not know why. He did not know why he felt the need to reach out for things that were going to hurt him, why the things that wanted to hurt him always seemed eager to reach back.

The figures in it were life-size, but there was something wrong with the colors. They blended into shadows that did not exist, like some darkness was creeping over the paint, pulling the figures back into a void. It felt like… there should be spirits there. Maybe they had already been swallowed by that darkness. West wondered if the others noticed him looking for the ghosts that were not there and tried to think of something light-hearted to say, a quip for the camera. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West said, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued, and if it came out a little forcefully, neither Devi nor Nellie reacted to it.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were bright blue under her fringe, with alight with a strange sorrowful accusation that made West avert his eyes. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that made it look like she was on her way to a Renaissance fair. It was cut low over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair fell in loose curls down her shoulders, and she lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, and West new that it must have been a hard position to hold, but Dawn seemed adept at performing her false relaxation. He left her to it. His eye was drawn to the man beside her.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.
Mark stood side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise, another precarious pose, another performance of ease, but Mark did not play his part quite so well. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. It was so carefully curated it set West’s teeth on edge, like something uncanny, almost veering into the inhuman. Which was ridiculous. Objectively, the man in the picture was just a man, if a very manicured one, his outfit not outrageous for the time. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro was pristine. Maybe it was his smile, that sneer, that made West want to run, that seemed to whisper in his ear// run run run//. Did he want to run from Mark? Was he responding to a threat? Or was a receiving a warning? 

West shook his head. He was not receiving a warning from a painting. There were no ghosts in this painting. He would feel them. He felt nothing in the darkness creeping over the paint. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn. Her deep brown eyes were wide and afraid, focused on something out of frame, and West felt that urge to run again, or to tell Tara to run, and he swallowed it down. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded almost completely into that suffocating void, like he could have been made of the darkness itself. He was shaped a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting something like a hand on Tara’s shoulder, but everything about him made West’s skin crawl. He did not look like any ghost West had seen. He did not look like the other Benningtons posed around him. So, who was he? If there were no ghosts in the gallery, what was possessing this portrait? 

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but West did not think he was. He thought he was something much worse than a dead man. They needed to leave.

//Run. //

“Right,” said West, keeping his voice calm. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go?”

“Hey, guys,” said Devi, stopping West after he took his first few steps towards the door. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

Classic haunting. West was surprised at how relieved he felt. He knew how to handle ghostly music. The normalcy took away some of his urgency, dampened a bit of his fear.

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

But as he turned to walk to her, he stumbled over his feet, and without thinking, he reached out to steady himself. His hand pressed against the painting. 

He felt a sharp pain, like his skin was splitting open, a searing rupture so intense that when he opened his mouth to scream no sound came out. There was a darkness growing from under his palm and a terrible sour smell. Mold? It spread out from his burning hand, over the painting, obscuring the faces of the Bennington children under the new wet growth.

“What the hell?” whispered Nellie.

West wrenched his hand free. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands of their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and West heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building. West could still hear that sound through the chaos, some familiar noises mixed in with the static, melodies and lyrics, songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for West to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

They stared into the dip of the giant bowl. Devi glared at West, clearly expecting him to say something dismissive, but West was actually… compelled? Is this how modern art was supposed to make you feel? The subtle curve of the bowl, the design spreading through it was hypnotic. It made him feel melancholy. It made him feel sick.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. 

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. 

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip, directing their attention to a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

He was glad Nellie had touched it and not him. He wanted to touch it. He did not know why. He did not know why he felt the need to reach out for things that were going to hurt him, why the things that wanted to hurt him always seemed eager to reach back.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi proposed.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

West could tell Devi was about to say something else, maybe argue with Nellie or give a long history about why three women dancing together was artistic, or sexist, or historically significant, but those blank faces were starting to creep him out.

The figures in it were life-size, but there was something wrong with the colors. They blended into shadows that did not exist, like some darkness was creeping over the paint, pulling the figures back into a void. It felt like… there should be spirits there. Maybe they had already been swallowed by that darkness. West wondered if the others noticed him looking for the ghosts that were not there and tried to think of something light-hearted to say, a quip for the camera. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West said, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued, and if it came out a little forcefully, neither Devi nor Nellie reacted to it.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were bright blue under her fringe, with alight with a strange sorrowful accusation that made West avert his eyes. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that made it look like she was on her way to a Renaissance fair. It was cut low over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair fell in loose curls down her shoulders, and she lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, and West new that it must have been a hard position to hold, but Dawn seemed adept at performing her false relaxation. He left her to it. His eye was drawn to the man beside her.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.
Mark stood side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise, another precarious pose, another performance of ease, but Mark did not play his part quite so well. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. It was so carefully curated it set West’s teeth on edge, like something uncanny, almost veering into the inhuman. Which was ridiculous. Objectively, the man in the picture was just a man, if a very manicured one, his outfit not outrageous for the time. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro was pristine. Maybe it was his smile, that sneer, that made West want to run, that seemed to whisper in his ear// run run run//. Did he want to run from Mark? Was he responding to a threat? Or was a receiving a warning? 

West shook his head. He was not receiving a warning from a painting. There were no ghosts in this painting. He would feel them. He felt nothing in the darkness creeping over the paint. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn. Her deep brown eyes were wide and afraid, focused on something out of frame, and West felt that urge to run again, or to tell Tara to run, and he swallowed it down. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded almost completely into that suffocating void, like he could have been made of the darkness itself. He was shaped a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting something like a hand on Tara’s shoulder, but everything about him made West’s skin crawl. He did not look like any ghost West had seen. He did not look like the other Benningtons posed around him. So, who was he? If there were no ghosts in the gallery, what was possessing this portrait? 

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but West did not think he was. He thought he was something much worse than a dead man. They needed to leave.

//Run. //

“Right,” said West, keeping his voice calm. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go?”

“Hey, guys,” said Devi, stopping West after he took his first few steps towards the door. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

Classic haunting. West was surprised at how relieved he felt. He knew how to handle ghostly music. The normalcy took away some of his urgency, dampened a bit of his fear.

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

But as he turned to walk to her, he stumbled over his feet, and without thinking, he reached out to steady himself. His hand pressed against the painting. 

He felt a sharp pain, like his skin was splitting open, a searing rupture so intense that when he opened his mouth to scream no sound came out. There was a darkness growing from under his palm and a terrible sour smell. Mold? It spread out from his burning hand, over the painting, obscuring the faces of the Bennington children under the new wet growth.

“What the hell?” whispered Nellie.

West wrenched his hand free. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands of their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and West heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building. West could still hear that sound through the chaos, some familiar noises mixed in with the static, melodies and lyrics, songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for West to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

The figures in it were life-size, but there was something wrong with the colors. They blended into shadows that did not exist, like some darkness was creeping over the paint, pulling the figures back into a void. It felt like… there should be spirits there. Maybe they had already been swallowed by that darkness. West wondered if the others noticed him looking for the ghosts that were not there and tried to think of something light-hearted to say, a quip for the camera. 

“I didn’t think people still had oil paintings made of themselves,” West said, filming each of the faces in the portrait. “Even the rich ones.”

“It might have been more normal in the 70s,” Devi suggested. 

“Nothing about this family was normal,” West argued, and if it came out a little forcefully, neither Devi nor Nellie reacted to it.

“Which one is she?” Nellie asked, pointing to the blond with the feathered fringe. 
“I think that one’s Dawn, the one who hanged herself,” said Devi. 

Dawn’s eyes were bright blue under her fringe, with alight with a strange sorrowful accusation that made West avert his eyes. Her dress was a much paler blue, willowy, with balloon-sleeves that made it look like she was on her way to a Renaissance fair. It was cut low over her chest, clearly displaying the locket that she wore. Her blonde hair fell in loose curls down her shoulders, and she lounged in the forefront of the picture, on a chaise longue. One elbow was set on the spiralled armrest so her delicate hand could prop up her head, while the other hand sat limply in her lap. She had tucked both her legs on the chaise, and West new that it must have been a hard position to hold, but Dawn seemed adept at performing her false relaxation. He left her to it. His eye was drawn to the man beside her.

“The man on the right is Mark, the one who might be buried in the garden,” said Devi.
Mark stood side-on to the room, one foot balanced behind him to press against the post of the chaise, another precarious pose, another performance of ease, but Mark did not play his part quite so well. His black shoes came to a point at the toe, his black pants flared at the base, and his shirt was a deep green with puffed sleeves and a series of ruffles that cascaded down his chest. It was so carefully curated it set West’s teeth on edge, like something uncanny, almost veering into the inhuman. Which was ridiculous. Objectively, the man in the picture was just a man, if a very manicured one, his outfit not outrageous for the time. His skin was dark brown, darker than West’s, and his neatly cut afro was pristine. Maybe it was his smile, that sneer, that made West want to run, that seemed to whisper in his ear// run run run//. Did he want to run from Mark? Was he responding to a threat? Or was a receiving a warning? 

West shook his head. He was not receiving a warning from a painting. There were no ghosts in this painting. He would feel them. He felt nothing in the darkness creeping over the paint. 

“And that one’s Tara, the one who took care of Bradford,” said Devi.

Tara was probably around fifteen years old in the portrait, but she wore a dress that looked like it belonged on a much younger girl. It was pink, covered in white ribbons that matched the white ribbon holding back her dark curls. The bright pink of her dress brough out the reddish undertones of her brown skin. She perched on the edge of the chaise opposite from Mark, to the left of Dawn. Her deep brown eyes were wide and afraid, focused on something out of frame, and West felt that urge to run again, or to tell Tara to run, and he swallowed it down. 

“The man in the back must be Bradford,” Devi said, but she didn’t sound certain.

The figure standing behind the chaise had faded almost completely into that suffocating void, like he could have been made of the darkness itself. He was shaped a man, appeared to have dark hair, and was resting something like a hand on Tara’s shoulder, but everything about him made West’s skin crawl. He did not look like any ghost West had seen. He did not look like the other Benningtons posed around him. So, who was he? If there were no ghosts in the gallery, what was possessing this portrait? 

“Have you seen any pictures of Bradford?” West asked.

“Which one of his kids looked most like him?” Nellie asked.

“I have,” said Devi. “And none of them. They all took after their respective moms.”

This man could have been Bradford, but West did not think he was. He thought he was something much worse than a dead man. They needed to leave.

//Run. //

“Right,” said West, keeping his voice calm. “Lovers, plural. Forgot about that. Should we go?”

“Hey, guys,” said Devi, stopping West after he took his first few steps towards the door. “I’m getting something on my mic again. Music, I know it, but it’s really faint.”

Classic haunting. West was surprised at how relieved he felt. He knew how to handle ghostly music. The normalcy took away some of his urgency, dampened a bit of his fear.

“Then turn it up!” West laughed.

But as he turned to walk to her, he stumbled over his feet, and without thinking, he reached out to steady himself. His hand pressed against the painting. 

He felt a sharp pain, like his skin was splitting open, a searing rupture so intense that when he opened his mouth to scream no sound came out. There was a darkness growing from under his palm and a terrible sour smell. Mold? It spread out from his burning hand, over the painting, obscuring the faces of the Bennington children under the new wet growth.

“What the hell?” whispered Nellie.

West wrenched his hand free. 

The room exploded in sound and all three crew members clapped their hands of their ears. Devi gave a shriek for the brief moment hers were uncovered after she tore off her headphones, before she clasped her hands to her ears to drown out the noise. Even then, it was painfully loud, warbled words and electric tones. The room plunged into darkness as the light on West’s camera went out along with the dots of light on Devi’s recorder, and every star outside and the moon disappeared. The ground started to shake under their feet, and West heard someone laughing as they struggled to stand upright, the deep crackling voice of a monster. The walls groaned, popped, as the earth shifted under the building. West could still hear that sound through the chaos, some familiar noises mixed in with the static, melodies and lyrics, songs, perhaps hundreds of songs, all playing on top of each other, at once. Suddenly, all the noise stopped except for one tune, playing just long enough for West to recognize it before the Gallery stopped shaking, the light of the stars returned, and the song faded into silence.

“Is it a metaphor?” West asked, feeling stupid.

“If it is, I don’t get it,” said Nellie, making West feel slightly better.

“I think it represents…” Devi said, trailing off as West and Nellie tried to hide their smirks. “Never mind!”

“No, Devi, please, what do the white blocks represent?” West asked, pointing the camera at her.

She stuck her tongue out for the audience.

“I think they represent the limitation of verbal communication,” Nellie said with faux seriousness.

West swept the camera over to her.

“Or perhaps the limitlessness of visual communication,” he suggested and she nodded sagely.

“Fine, I’ll keep my analysis to myself!” Devi said while West and Nellie giggled.

“Do you want me to do anything in front of those?” Nellie asked.

“No, I’m just getting creepy B-roll,” West said.

“Okay… Boring…”

West pointed the camera at Nellie. “Fine, do something not boring.”

Nellie threw her hands up in the air dramatically and wandered next to an uncomfortable Devi.

“Maybe we should focus on the art,” Devi suggested.

They stared into the dip of the giant bowl. Devi glared at West, clearly expecting him to say something dismissive, but West was actually… compelled? Is this how modern art was supposed to make you feel? The subtle curve of the bowl, the design spreading through it was hypnotic. It made him feel melancholy. It made him feel sick.

“The Fountain of Life has gone dry,” Nellie declared. 

“It never had water in it,” Devi said. 

“Look,” West said, pointing his camera into the dip, directing their attention to a detailed etching of a giant V or curving horns. 

Nellie reached into the bowl, running her hand along the etching. 

“You know what? I like it,” Nellie said. “It’s simple, but it sends a message.”

He was glad Nellie had touched it and not him. He wanted to touch it. He did not know why. He did not know why he felt the need to reach out for things that were going to hurt him, why the things that wanted to hurt him always seemed eager to reach back. He blinked away tears before Nellie or Devi could see them. 

“I don’t, it gives me the creeps,” said West. “Let’s look at something else.”

He supposed it looked like three women dancing. If you squinted. Or looked past them and just tried to glance at them out of the corner of your eye. Which seemed like a weird way to view a work of art, but probably the right way, because it did do something strange. The way the blur made the trio split in his vision, each trio creating its own trio, gave the illusion of movement. Interesting, perhaps, but it did not change how unnerving their blank, faceless… faces… were.

Modern art usually had some metaphorical meaning that was more important than the art itself. Even just thinking that to himself made West feel unbelievably pretentious. 

“Do you think they’re supposed to be the Greek fates?” asked West.

“Maybe they’re the Norse fates,” Devi proposed.

“I think art is just full of three women dancing together,” Nellie said.

West could tell Devi was about to say something else, maybe argue with Nellie or give a long history about why three women dancing together was artistic, or sexist, or historically significant, but those blank faces were starting to creep him out.

He felt something burning him, more like rage than fire, hot and small and concentrated… He reached into his pocket and pulled out the locket. It wasn’t really hot. It was angry. It was haunted. 

There was a ghost in the locket. He had seen ghosts trapped in houses, in cupboards, in graveyards of course. He had even seen ghosts haunt people, like a shadow following them, or even something inhabiting their skin. But he had never experienced whatever kind of haunting this was. The locket burned hotter, and West had a flash of an image, the clawed teeth of a bear trap. A trap.

The ground rumbled again, tearing him away from this mystery. He looked up to see Devi, frozen in place, Nellie, her eyes glued to the locket in his hand. 

“That was an earthquake, we have to get out of here!” West shouted at them.

Devi seemed to come back to herself, eyes hardening with resolve as she ran out of the gallery. Nellie was a step or two behind her, unable to hide her hesitation. West tightened his grip and ran after them. 

The mandala of rocks in the garden had been upset by the shaking ground, the path ruined. Devi had put her headphones on again and was listening intently as she stumbled forward, but Nellie stopped right in front of West, halting his progress. 

“Nellie! Earthquake! Move!” West shouted.

“It’s the locket,” she said, her voice unnaturally calm. “Whatever is going on, we made it happen when we took it. When we brought it back to Dawn.”

“How do you know it’s Dawn?” Devi asked.

Nellie stared at West. He did not know how she knew. He just knew she was right.

“You think an earthquake happened because a ghost is mad that we stole her jewellery?” West asked, trying for a scoff that Nellie was not buying. 

“I don’t think that’s why she’s mad,” Nellie said. “I think… I think she needs help.”

The image of the bear trap flashed again in West’s mind.

“How do we help a ghost?” Devi asked, grabbing West’s arm when the ground shook again.

“We set her free,” said Nellie.

Nellie snapped out of her frozen terror and grabbed Devi’s arm. West trusted they would follow and ran out of the gallery, to the looming cacti, but jolted to a stop when an unfamiliar face materialized in front of him. He heard the sound of skidding rocks as his crewmates stopped short behind him.

“West, what the hell?” Nellie hissed by his shoulder.

“Um…”

The face wasn’t entirely unfamiliar. It was the ghost who had been walking the mandala, with the long braid. But there was something uncanny about her features that West did not have time to consider too hard. The ghost was pointing at him. At his pants? He patted his pocket and pulled out the diary.

“West, what are you doing?” Devi asked.

“I’m… looking…”

The ghost nodded, and West began to flip through the diary while she stared down at the pages, frowning, waving her hand impatiently for him to keep going.

“Oh my god,” said Nellie. “West, is there a… presence here?”

“West doesn’t even believe in that sort of thing,” Devi snapped.

“Shut up, both of you, I’m trying to pay attention to the ghost.”

Nellie gave an excited squeal and West ignored whatever she whispered to Devi. They could record all they wanted. This ghost wasn’t saying anything. Not with words, at least. West finally reached a page that made her point excitedly before she disappeared.

“She wanted me to read this,” said West.

“She?” asked Devi, her voice strained.

“What does it say?” asked Nellie, leaning close over his shoulder. 

The three investigators read together:

//If He is released, called forth in his Hunger for what was promised, father’s trick of using the key can lock Verziz away but leaves His power out of reach… still hope His power will be His end, but I’ll keep key safe in here for now.//

West flipped through the book. Nothing. No key.

The pain from his split hand, split and dripping that black mold, was writhing under his skin. He felt something burning him, more like rage than fire, hot and small and concentrated… He reached into his pocket and pulled out the locket. It wasn’t really hot. It was angry. It was haunted. 

There was a ghost in the locket, and there was something inside him, something worse. It seeped out of his open hand, covering the locket, a thin sheen of sludge turning the gold a muted gray. He had never experienced whatever kind of haunting this was, whatever trapped the ghost in the jewellery, whatever was seeping inside of him, out of him. The locket burned hotter, like a fever now, as sick as he was and West had a flash of an image, the clawed teeth of a bear trap. A trap, oozing black mold. 

The ground rumbled again, tearing him away from this mystery. He looked up to see Devi, frozen in place, a hand over her mouth that could not cover the moan that escaped as she stared at West. Nellie made no noise, her eyes glued to the locket in his hand. 

“What’s happening to me?” West asked, and drool dripped from the corners of his mouth.

He wiped it away with the back of his hand, leaving a trail of sludge on his skin. 

“It’s the locket,” Nellie said, her voice unnaturally calm. “Whatever is going on, we made it happen when we took it. When we brought it back to Dawn.”

“How do you know it’s Dawn?” Devi asked.

Nellie stared at West. He did not know how she knew. He just knew she was right. 

“You think an earthquake happened because a ghost is mad that we stole her jewellery?” West asked, uncertain, but what else could explain what was happening to him? It felt like a punishment. A curse. “What do we do? How do we fix this?” 

“We set her free,” said Nellie. 

Devi seemed to come back to herself, eyes hardening with resolve as she ran out of the gallery, just a step behind Nellie who was already forging a straight line through the ruined stone mandala. West tightened his grip and ran after them, stumbling to stay on his feet as the earth trembled once more.

“We need to get him to an exorcist,” Nellie said, making a strange strangled sound that might have been a laugh, or a sob. 

West didn’t feel like he was possessed by anything, and there hadn’t been a ghost in the gallery to possess him. But there was something inside of him, something terrible and perhaps alive. It felt like a punishment. A curse.

He patted his pocket and pulled out Mark’s guitar pick.

Devi forced Nellie to a half when she realized West was no longer following them. 

“West, what are you doing?” Devi asked.

West coughed and something wet slid down the front of his hoodie. The ghost cringed away in disgust then disappeared. West stared at the pick held between his finger tips and watched as sludge oozed out of his pores and a soft black fuzz erupted over the small object pressed against his cursed skin.

“A ghost,” West murmured through lips that felt less like lips each passing second. “It… it was trying to tell me something.”

“You don’t believe in ghosts,” Devi said slowly.

“Seeing is believing,” said Nellie, her eyes bright. “What did it want us to do? Maybe the pick can help you. Let me see it.”

“No, no, we don’t have time for this. We need to get out of here,” he said. 

“The Séance Room is right by the entrance,” said Devi. 

“It’s a Séance Pit now, and the door is locked,” West said. 

“The Upper Séance Room, then,” said Devi. “Above the Groove Room. It leads right down to the pit. We can try to talk to her, figure out what to do. I can almost hear her…”

“No. We’re getting out of here,” West said. “We can, I don’t know, come back. If the mansion is still standing.”

“West,” Devi began, but Nellie cut her off.

“He’s right,” she said. “It’s too dangerous. Let’s go.”

She started racing towards the mansion and West was too relieved to do anything but follow her. Devi still seemed distressed, holding the headphones against her ears, listening intently, shaking her head. He wanted to say something to comfort her, but there was no way he was coming back here, and if he started talking, she might notice the lie. He kept expecting her to stop him. As they passed the photos of celebrities in the hall, Devi’s eyes slid over his shoulder, widened, and she nodded slightly. Before West could look behind him to see what she had seen, another quake rocked the mansion and Devi fell forward, completely off balance. Without thinking, West reached out to grab her.

The locket clattered to the floor for a second before Nellie scooped it up, sprinting into the Groove Room.

“Nellie, no!” 

Devi righted herself, not off-balance, of course. West cursed and the two rushed after Nellie, but they did not have to rush very far. Nellie had frozen at the base of the stairs. And someone was walking down towards them – the ghost of a woman with dark almond eyes, cropped black hair. West averted his eyes, trying to pretend he did not see the ghost, then noticed Nellie and Devi were staring right at her. 

“Emma?” Nellie whispered.

Emma let out a small gasp and smiled, reaching out her hands to Nellie who reached back before West could even think about if it was a terrible idea. But it did not matter. She was not reaching for Nellie, but for the locket, which she plucked from the confused investigator’s grasp. 

“Oh, Dawn,” Emma said. “I’ve been waiting here for so long.”

Another figure materialized in the room, with soft blond hair and a feathered fringe, throwing her arms around Emma’s shoulders.

“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry I made you wait,” said Dawn, and though her voice was remorseful, the ghost couldn’t contain her grin. “Someone put my locket in the library, and I was trapped inside-”

Emma hushed her.

“We’re together now.”

Dawn’s eyes flickered down for a moment, and West braced for another quake that did not come.

“What about-” she began, but Emma cut her off.

“We’re together now,” she insisted. “Whatever happens in the future, happens. For now, we have each other. Thanks to them.”

Dawn stared at the three investigators, and even though they had saved her from the locket, she did not look particularly impressed with what she saw.

“You should go,” Dawn said to West. “Compared to the other monsters in this mansion, I’m downright friendly.”

West had many questions, but not nearly enough curiosity to stick around and interrogate an unfriendly spirit that had apparently caused an earthquake to return to her dead lover. The thought of staying to prise the secrets of Bennington Mansion out of Dawn was almost as unbearable as the thought of driving for hours back to the hotel with Devi and Nellie who were currently radiating smugness. But he followed his crewmembers out, quickly leaving the ghosts behind him. As far as final investigations went, he supposed reuniting to lost souls was the best possible outcome.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1529" name="Take the Locket to the Basement" tags="" position="975,1550" size="100,100">The ground rumbled again. Devi’s hand felt so fragile on his arm, Nellie’s eyes were so still and vacant she looked half-dead. 

“No, no, we don’t have time for this. We need to get out of here,” he said. 

“The Séance Room is right by the entrance,” said Devi. 

“It’s a Séance Pit now, and the door is locked,” West said. 

“The Upper Séance Room, then,” said Devi. “Above the Groove Room. It leads right down to the pit. We can try to talk to her, figure out what to do. I can almost hear her…”
“No. We’re getting out of here,” West said. “We can, I don’t know, come back. If the mansion is still standing.”

“West,” Devi began, but Nellie cut her off.

“The Basement is right inside,” she said, her eyes sharp now, a strange desperation tightening her voice. “Everything in this house has pointed to that altar, that imagery, something from Bradford’s occult days. He did something to her down there that trapped her. He must have. Maybe we can use the altar to set her free.”

Before West could protest that going into a basement during an earthquake was a terrible idea, Nellie was already running, pulling Devi with her. The locket grew hotter in his hand, and he was overwhelmed with the ghost’s rage, that anger he always tried to avoid on investigations. It was more fury than he had felt in a long time, and though he did not love that he was following Nellie’s footsteps through the secret wardrobe, down to the depths, he mostly just wanted to be rid of the burning fire clenched in his fist. He was so focused on the pain he nearly stumbled into Nellie and Devi who were frozen at the base of the stairs. 

A man sat cross-legged on the altar.

The man was handsome, in an unusual way. His skin was a little too pale. His black hair was pushed messily back from his forehead. His shirt and ripped jeans were too tight, a trying-too-hard rockstar look, or maybe just a poor fit. His eyes were dark. He blinked slowly at them, squinting slightly, and West wondered if he could not see very well. But then the man’s eyes locked on West’s hand. Maybe he could see incredibly well, through West’s flesh, to the burning secret hidden in his fist. He smiled at the crewmembers, and the heat of the locket changed from rage to something to a different kind of intensity. Panic? Fear? West stared harder at the man, yes, definitely a man and not a ghost. But not human, West was sure, no matter how many little human touches there were in that poorly fitting outfit, that purposefully mussed hairstyle, those perfectly placed six freckles that crossed his cheeks. 

“Who are you?” Devi whispered.

“Call me Verses,” the man said. “I’m surprised you don’t know, if you came down here.”
Whoever, whatever he was, West did not think it best to engage with him. They needed to get out of there. 

“Can you help her?” Nellie asked, pointing to West’s hand, and it felt like the locket was screaming. “She’s trapped.”

“Oh, yes, I can help,” said the man. “I can free her from that trap. Give her to me.”

He held out his hand, but did not move from the altar. West was not going to take a step further. He did not trust the man, but the pain was becoming too much to bear, and West realized he was terrified. He just wanted to leave. He tossed the locket to Verses who caught it deftly. And any presence West had felt in the locket was gone. He shivered. Not free. Not “moving on,” as ghosts sometimes did. Just gone. 

“Is she…” Devi asked.

West grabbed Nellie and Devi, pushing them up the stairs as the man laughed behind them, a terrible hollow sound.

“If you find the others, I’d be happy to free them, too,” he called after them, his voice seeming to come from much further away than the basement.

At least the earthquakes had stopped. At least nothing grabbed them to trap them in the mansion as they ran to the car. At least the only person to die that night was already dead.

The split in his hand was growing, extending down his arm. The dull locket, gripped so tight, was half-buried in his skin. If it was still skin. As he pulled the locket out of the wound with his free hand, he felt the edges of his torn flesh scrape against his fingers with a roughness almost like burlap or woven hemp.

The two girls had stopped at his sound of pain. Devi looked at him, worry etched across her face. Nellie also looked concerned, but her eyes were on the locket.  

“The Séance Room is right by the entrance,” said Devi. “We need to hurry, West. You’re…”

“It’s a Séance Pit now, and the door is locked,” West said. 

“The Upper Séance Room, then,” said Devi. “Above the Groove Room. It leads right down to the pit. We can try to talk to her, figure out what to do. I can almost hear her…”

“Okay,” said West, panic tightening his chest as the skin on either side of the wound began to curl up and away from the sludge beneath. 

He gripped the locket in his left hand and let his infected arm hang limp as he raced after Nellie and Devi. They passed the photos of celebrities in the hall, and sprinted into the Groove Room, before stopping short at the bottom of the stairs. Someone was walking down towards them – the ghost of a woman with dark almond eyes, cropped black hair. West averted his eyes, trying to pretend he did not see the ghost, then noticed Nellie and Devi were staring right at her. 

“Emma?” Nellie whispered.

West reached out with his good hand, letting the locket hand loose on the chain. Emma let out a small gasp and smiled, plucking the jewellery from his grasp.  

“Oh, Dawn,” Emma said. “I’ve been waiting here for so long.”

Another figure materialized in the room, with soft blond hair and a feathered fringe... and a face entirely distorted by black mold. Emma’s face turned into a mask of horror. 

“What did you do to her?”

West could see wounds opening like seams in Dawn’s arms, what was Dawn, at least. It seemed disoriented and moved with a violent jerk, throwing its arms forward. Maybe it meant to reach out for Emma, maybe not, but its hands were in her hair now. The mold quickly spread over Emma’s featuring as well before both figures fell to their knees, disappearing, leaving only a stain of black sludge on the Groove Room rug. 

“I’m sorry,” Nellie whispered, over and over. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

West thought she was talking to the absent ghosts. But when he turned to look at her, she had Devi maneuvered Devi behind her, and both were backing slowly out of the room, horrified eyes locked on West. He tried to say something but could not speak over the sludge filling his mouth. He tried to take a step towards them, but his leg gave out, unspooled, spilled open. He hit the floor with a soft thunk, too soft, his head feeling strangely deflated against the rug. He saw Nellie and Devi’s feet as the ran from the room. He saw nothing else.

A man sat cross-legged on the altar.

The man was handsome, in an unusual way. His skin was a little too pale. His black hair was pushed messily back from his forehead. His shirt and ripped jeans were too tight, a trying-too-hard rockstar look, or maybe just a poor fit. His eyes were dark. He blinked slowly at them, squinting slightly, and West wondered if he could not see very well. But then the man’s eyes locked on West and he scowled, and suddenly he did not look like a man at all. Not a ghost, either. Something terrible and now, something angry.

“You corrupted my offering with that filth?” he hissed, and it sounded like the static from before, and if West could have clamped his hands over his ears again like Nellie and Devi were then he would have, but now both hung limp and dead at his sides. “Are you trying to destroy me, too? Or merely mock me? Foolish creatures, you have made a grave mistake. I will have my fill for today as payment for what you took from me.”

There was a rush of air, like a vacuum opening around them, all static and pressure and noise and pain. West could hear Nellie and Devi screaming, saw their eyes grow terrified then go blank and lifeless before they fell to the ground. The man looked at him with disgust, and West felt a different kind of pressure like a strong wind push him back towards the stairs. Try to push him back. What was left of his skin could not handle the strain. He felt himself unravel, he saw a spray of sludge on the floor that made the man recoil, even though it never touched him. What would happen if it touched him? 

West would never find out.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1532" name="Take Diary to Upper Observatory" tags="" position="1350,1550" size="100,100">“Didn’t something fall out of the diary when you opened it?” Devi asked?

“Shit,” said West.

“Not shit, we know where the key is,” said Nellie excitedly. “We can…”

The ground roiled beneath their feet.

“Exactly, we have no idea what we’d even be doing with this key,” said West, throwing his arms out for balance. “We need to get out of here.”

“We did something, we set something off, we need to stop it,” snapped Nellie. “We released something bad and it’s literally rocking the world.”

“Nellie’s right,” said Devi. “Do what you want, West. We’re going to get the key.”

West watched them run away from him for a moment before swearing and following them inside, to the library, up the stairs. They all fell to their knees, hands sweeping across the floor, sticking their fingers into the cracks in the wood panels.

“I think I found it,” said Nellie, but her voice wavered. “There’s something here, but I can’t get it out.”

She was trying to catch the corner with the tip of her nail, but the manicured edge was too short, too round. 

“Okay, we tried,” said West. “Now can we leave?”

There was a straining sound as the panelling rose beneath them in a surreal kind of wave as the earth shook again. But the smooth motion was upset by the sound of a sharp crack, foundations bending too far, breaking. There was a short jerk as the room fell a foot or two. The investigators looked at each other, eyes wide. And then the floor completely gave way. West heard Nellie scream, saw a wall come crashing towards him and felt a sharp pain before all was darkness. 

[[End of Track]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1533" name="Take Diary to Séance Room" tags="" position="1350,1675" size="100,100">“Isn’t the Séance Room door locked?” asked West. 

“A lot of doors are locked,” Devi said slowly.

The ground roiled beneath their feet.

“Well, we don’t have time to check a lot of doors,” said Nellie, bracing herself against the revolting earth. “And the Séance Room is a suspicious enough place to start.”

“And, you know, end if we’re wrong, considering it’s near the front door,” said West. 

They ran together into the mansion, past the hall of portraits, to the door to the Séance Room. West examined the keyhole.

“Do you see anything?” asked Devi. 

For a moment… A distorted face? Pale, drawn, eyes so black, two deep voids. And then he was being pulled backwards, a hand gripping hard on his shoulder.

“Who the hell are you?” Nellie screamed as West righted himself and saw the unfamiliar woman who had grabbed him.

Long grey curls covered half her face, but he could see her eyes, filled with rage. And since the others could see her, too, it didn’t matter how unsettling she looked, how her rage made her nearly vibrate off the ground. This was a person, not a ghost. But a person came with its own kind of dangers.

“Don’t touch me!” West screamed as the woman started reaching for him again.
“Thieves!” she shouted, her voice raspy and harsh.

Thieves? West pulled the diary out of his pocket and the woman snatched it from him and began flipping through it, frantic. Nellie was inching backwards, towards the door, but Devi was rooted in spot, eyes wide.

“Tara?” she asked.

The woman ignored her, glaring up at West.

“Where is the key?” she snapped.

They didn’t have the key. The door was locked. There was nothing. 

The woman, Tara, lunged at him with a feral shriek, her fists balling the fabric of his hoodie and forcing him backwards, towards the Séance Room. His back hit the door, and West heard a snapping sound before it broke free behind him. He grabbed at the woman, trying to stay on his feet, but he was already falling, and between her grip on him and his grip on her, she was falling with him. He could hear Devi screaming something but could not make it out over the wind rushing past his ears as he fell. He thought he heard laughter, as hollow as a dying star, before he finally, finally hit the ground and splintered.

“We did something, we set something off, we need to stop it,” snapped Nellie. “We released something bad and it’s literally rocking the world.”

“Nellie’s right,” said Devi. “Do what you want, West. We’re going to get the key.”

West watched them run away from him for a moment before swearing and following them inside, to the library, up the stairs. They all fell to their knees, hands sweeping across the floor, sticking their fingers into the cracks in the wood panels.

“I think I found it,” said Nellie, but her voice wavered. “There’s something here, but I can’t get it out.”

She was trying to catch the corner with the tip of her nail, but the manicured edge was too short, too round. 

“Let me try,” said West, pushing her out of the way.

Before she could protest he fished the guitar pick out of his pocket, using the pointed tip to coax the object from it tight fit in the crack. He managed to get enough of it out to pinch the edge with his fingers, pulling it free. 

“What is that, a compact?” asked Nellie?

“It’s glass,” said West. “A circle of glass. Not really a key.”

“A lens,” said Devi. “The telescope.”

They looked over at the telescope. The wooden floor rose in a surreal wave under their feet and West ignored his confusion, rushing to the telescope, fitting the lens in place. And the quake stopped.

“Was that because of us?” Devi asked.

“Don’t care, let’s go,” said West.

They hurried out of the mansion, waiting for aftershocks that never came. As they drove away, West shook his head. Ghosts, yes, there would always be ghosts. Ghosts that could cause earthquakes? Ghosts that could be locked away with a telescope lens? Ridiculous. 

“I bet it was a coincidence,” he muttered, and Nellie smacked him on the back of the head.

The woman ignored her, glaring up at West.

“Where is the key?” she snapped.

They didn’t have the key. The door was locked. But something in the woman’s rage filled eyes made West sure he needed to give her something, and fast, or there would be terrible consequences.

“Oh, yeah, the key,” he said digging into his pocket, noticing how Tara, if that was Tara Bennington, relaxed slightly. “It’s right here.”

His hand gripped the guitar pick he found in Mark’s room. He threw it down the hall, and Tara shrieked as she heard the sound of it clatter against a picture frame. She bolted after it and West turned and ran towards the door, glad he did not have to convince Nellie and Devi to run with him. He heard Tara scream in rage, probably when she realized that the guitar pick was not whatever key she was looking for, but by then they were already out the door. The ground continued to shake as the jumped into the car, driving away, but it had to stop eventually. 

“We didn’t really release something terrible, right?” Devi asked from the back seat, her voice soft.

“If we did, it’s Tara’s problem now,” Nellie muttered.

West nodded, but he wasn’t so sure. Hopefully, Tara could find the key. Whatever it was. Hopefully, she could undo whatever they started in Bennington Mansion.

“Isn’t the Séance Room door locked?” asked West. 

The ground roiled beneath their feet.

“Well, we don’t have time to reason through our options,” said Nellie, bracing herself against the revolting earth. “And the Séance Room is a suspicious enough place to start.”

“Okay, okay, you’re right,” said West. “Let’s go.”

They ran together into the mansion, past the hall of portraits, to the door to the Séance Room. Nellie tried the door, which would not budge, then jumped out of the way when West staggered forward to peer through the keyhole. 

“Do you see anything?” asked Devi. 

For a moment… A distorted face? Pale, drawn, eyes so black, two deep voids. And then he was being pulled backwards, a hand gripping hard on his shoulder.

But a person came with its own kind of dangers.

“Don’t touch me!” West warned the woman, too late.

She stared at her hands, which had gone fuzzy with mold, her eyes widening as she got a clear look at West’s face.

“So, this is how it ends?” she murmured, as sludge began to drip from her lips.

“What do we do?” Devi asked, her voice high pitched. “Oh shit, what do we do?”
“Run,” said West.

He fell to his knees. The mush that was left of what used to be his knees. The woman stared over her shoulder at the two girls and nodded, slowly, sadly.

“What?” asked Nellie.

“Don’t touch me,” said West. “And run.”

He heard their footsteps retreating behind him. He watched the woman fall apart in front of him as he fell apart with her.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1537" name="Take West to the Basement" tags="" position="1850,1550" size="100,100">“Let’s go to the basement,” said Devi. “It was super weird. And this is super weird. Maybe there’s a connection.”

“Flawless logic, Devi,” Nellie hissed.

“Do you have a better idea?”

The ground shook beneath them.

“We don’t have time to think of one,” said West. “Let’s go.”

They ran into Bradford’s Bedroom before West stopped with a hiss. The split in his hand was growing, extending down his arm. He gingerly touched the edges of his torn flesh and they scraped against his fingers with a roughness almost like burlap or woven hemp. 

The two girls had stopped at his sound of pain. Devi looked at him, worry etched across her face. 

“The Basement is right here,” Devi said, her voice gentle, soothing. “Everything in this house has pointed to that altar, that imagery, something from Bradford’s occult days. Maybe we can use it to, I don’t know, cleanse you of whatever this is.”

“Okay,” said West, panic tightening his chest as the skin on either side of the wound began to curl up and away from the sludge beneath. 

They ran through the wardrobe, down the stairs, and froze. 

A man sat cross-legged on the altar.

The man was handsome, in an unusual way. His skin was a little too pale. His black hair was pushed messily back from his forehead. His shirt and ripped jeans were too tight, a trying-too-hard rockstar look, or maybe just a poor fit. His eyes were dark. He blinked slowly at them, squinting slightly, and West wondered if he could not see very well. But then the man’s eyes locked on West and he scowled, and suddenly he did not look like a man at all. Not a ghost, either. Something terrible and now, something angry.

“You would seek to destroy me with that filth?” he hissed, and it sounded like the static from before, and if West could have clamped his hands over his ears again like Nellie and Devi were then he would have, but now both hung limp and dead at his sides. “You come here with so blatant a ploy? GET. OUT.”

There was a rush of air, a snap, and short scream. West saw Nellie’s and Devi’s bodies fly backwards up the stairs, like they were pushed by a great wind. His body was buffeted as well, but what was left of his skin could not handle the strain. He felt himself unravel before he even reached the first step, he saw a spray of sludge on the floor that made the man recoil, even though it never touched him. What would happen if it touched him? 

West would never find out.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1538" name="Give Nellie the Pick" tags="" position="1600,1550" size="100,100">Nellie’s took the pick from West’s grasp.

Her hand immediately sprouted black fuzz.

“What the hell, what the hell!” she screamed, dropping it, but it was too late.

The fuzz spread down her arm, up her neck, to her mouth. 

“What do I do?” Devi asked, her voice almost inaudible.

“Help me!” Nellie screamed, but West grabbed her arm before she could get close to Devi.

“Run,” he said staring at her, and Devi cringed away from whatever she saw on his face. “There’s nothing we can do. Run.”

Devi ran.

Nellie screamed after her, pleas and swears, but could not break free of West’s grip, surprisingly strong despite the fact that his insides felt like they had nearly dissolved. She must have been deteriorating faster than him. They fell together to the disrupted stones of the mandala, and West watched Nellie’s lovely cheek slide off her face to the earth below. He could feel his own skin sloughing off. He hoped his eyes were fall away soon, and he would not have to see his fate reflected in Nellie’s deteriorating features any longer. 

[[End of Track]] 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1539" name="Refuse to Give Nellie the Pick" tags="" position="1600,1675" size="100,100">“No,” said West, clutching the pick close to his chest. “Look at it, Nellie. It’s infected.”
“Infected?” she asked, taking a step back.

“Then what are we supposed to do?” Devi asked. “What was… the ghost… trying to say?”

“I don’t know,” said West. He felt something detach inside him, slide with a thunk towards his hips, and had a terrible feeling that it was not something that was ever meant to detach. “I don’t think there’s anything to do.”

“What do you mean?” Devi asked.

“I think you should go,” West said. “Before you get infected, too.”

Devi was shaking her head, but Nellie had already grabbed her arm, was pulling her away.

“He’s right,” she said, shakily, eyeing the tear in his hand that had gotten wider, the split growing down his arm that oozed black sludge. “It could spread to us to. We can’t let it get out. Whatever we did, it needs to stay here.”

“No, no,” Devi whispered, but she did not fight Nellie as she pulled her away, her eyes full of silent apologies that meant nothing.

He expected them to go. It still hurt. It was still the right thing to do.

His knees gave out and he fell to the mandala as the earth rolled again, upsetting several of the large cacti that fell over, pulling much of the ground up with them. He felt his body falling apart as he rested a too-soft head against the ground. He could picture his now inhuman face perfectly, a sack of flesh sewn over lumpy mold. Sewn? Why was he imagining stitches?

He was not imagining anything. 

At the base of the cacti, unearthed by the quake, was another figure of mold, of inhuman flesh, a cursed body no longer buried below the garden. West did not know what to do with this revelation. It did not matter. He did not have much time to consider it before his body completely dissolved.
